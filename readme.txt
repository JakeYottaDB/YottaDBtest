Documentation on usage is under development as time permits and will be released from time to time. For the present, please read the shell scripts. The .csh files are shell scripts written for the tcsh shell.

LICENSE
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you receive this package integrated with a GT.M distribution, the license for your GT.M distribution is also your license for this package.

In the event the package contains a COPYING file, that is your license for this package. Except as noted here, you must retain that file and include it if you redistribute the package or a derivative work thereof.

If you have a signed agreement providing you with GT.M under a different license from that in the COPYING file, you may, at your option, delete the COPYING file and use the GT.M regression test suite as an integral part of GT.M under the same terms as that of the GT.M license. If your GT.M license permits redistribution, you may redistribute the GT.M regression test suite integrated with GT.M under the terms of that license.

Simple aggregation or bundling of this package with another for distribution does not create a derivative work. To make clear the distinction between this package and another with which it is aggregated or bundled, it suffices to place the package in a separate directory or folder when distributing the aggregate or bundle.

Should you receive this package not integrated with a GT.M distribution, and missing a COPYING file, you may create a file called COPYING from the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 or later (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.txt) and use this package under the terms of that license.
