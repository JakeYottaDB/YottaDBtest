# This test requires MM (it tries to exercise concurrent-db-file-extension-logic in wcs_mm_recover).
# So force MM and therefore disable encryption as well (since that does not run with MM).
# Since we need specific allocations/extension values for multiple regions, use a custom gde file.
# Create two regions DEFAULT and AREG

# Populate nodes in database
# Verify that DEFAULT region has NO free blocks (needed by parent^gtm8523). Exit test if verification fails
Free Blocks in DEFAULT region is 0 : Expecting 0. Continuing...
# Initialize white-box variables
# Run backup in background
# Set gtm_wbox_mrtn to child^gtm8523 so this is spawned off by parent^gtm8523 when it reaches gdsfilext()
# Run TP transaction which in turn spawns off a child to do the concurrent db file extension
# Without the code fix for GTM-8523, we expect a SIG-11 from this parent process inside gvcst_blk_build()
# Clear white-box variables
# Wait for background backup to finish
# Check db integrity
