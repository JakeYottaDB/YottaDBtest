==Executing MULTISITE_REPLIC 'STARTSRC INST1 INST2 RP'==
Do first set of updates. The first jnl_seqno has ~ 4Mb of journal data so source server will expand its internal buffers
Start receiver server after updates are done to ensure source server reads first jnl_seqno from files
==Executing MULTISITE_REPLIC 'STARTRCV INST1 INST2'==
Sleep at least two heartbeat periods (8 seconds each) to ensure source server trims its internal buffers
Stop receiver server before second set of updates to ensure source server reads those from journal files as well
==Executing MULTISITE_REPLIC 'STOPRCV INST1 INST2'==
Do second set of updates. This has ~ 3Mb of journal data so source server does not need to expand its buffers as much as before
Start receiver server so source server now sends from files
==Executing MULTISITE_REPLIC 'STARTRCV INST1 INST2'==
Check that source server has sent all data without issues
