The test rx0 cannot run like other test scripts because the main purpose of
rx0 is to test the command "r x:0". It will timeout immediately if there is 
nothing ALREADY available. But our usual way to do the test is to do it by 
the instream.csh, which is exactly one of the ways that makes something 
ALREADY available to a read. I am trying to find another way to test it, but
for now, you might want to do the test by hand. Just start the GT.M. and write
the command "d ^rx0". And see if it PASS.

rx0.m JOBs a seond process that kills the first after a few seconds - when
manually run this seems unnecessary (or even confusing), but is a residual from
earlier attempts at more automation and is left for now. Also, on VMS V999 used 
for daily testing has $zv V9.9-0 and won't work since rx0start.com will have the
wrong ver command.

If you are running the same copy in a different server (if the files are in NFS), make sure you delete .o before you run again.
