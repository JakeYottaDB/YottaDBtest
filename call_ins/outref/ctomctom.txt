M1, C->M->C->M

Using sqrt2 the root of 81 is 9
Now <Set square=$&squarec(root)> will do external call to C

M2, C-> M -> C -> M

C2, C-> M -> C -> M
val = 9
Using squarec.c The square of 9 is 81
Call into cubeit^cube returns the cube of 9 as 729

External call routine sqrt2 returning to the square of 81 as 81
