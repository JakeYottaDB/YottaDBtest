# Randomly change the max keysize of a few databases - to keep it out of sync with .gld values
# Randomly open a few regions by doing global refrences that map to those regions
# Check there is no memory addition due to repeated view NOISOLATION
# Open the remaining regions by doing corresponding global references. There should be no errors
