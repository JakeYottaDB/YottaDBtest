# # This file lists the most common configurations.
# # Any combination that is not here will be numbered in binary fashion depending on the options (e.g. NON_REPLIC would be 0, REPLIC would be 1, etc.) plus MAXDEF.
# # This file's format is
# # num opt1 opt2 opt3 ... optn
# # In the binary numbering, opt1 will be lsd, optn will be most significant digit.
# # For now, the only combination of test in SUITE that is not here is the tests with MULTISITE which evaluates to 49 i.e dualfail_ms_49
