PER 1831, 2416, 2482, 2733, 2739, 2745:

	These tests appear to work and the reference output appears to
	be correct.  They need to be verified.


PER 1633, 2422:

	These tests are commented-out and appear to do with journaling.


PER 2601:

	This test has been commented-out.  The shell script looks like a
	VMS DCL command file (with hard-coded references to Bernie Metzger's
	home directory) and it refers to a GDE input file that does not
	exist in this directory.  This looks suspiciously like a VMS-only
	test (and, in fact, the problem may only exist on VMS).  In any case,
	if it is to run on Unix, the test needs to be dramatically
	restructured.


PER 2607:

	It appears as if the invocation of per2607a.csh should precede
	the commented-out invocation of per2607f.m and per2607g.m because
	it appears to establish the journal files used later.  Perhaps all
	of the parts of the per2607 test should be gathered together into
	a single contiguous portion of this test.

	Only per2607a.csh is used,
	per2607b.csh . . . per2707h.csh are not used by this test.

	The tests that invoke per2607f.m and per2607g.m are commented
	out.


PER 2996:

	This is clearly a VMS test for mailbox timeouts.  If applicable to
	Unix, it needs to be re-written; if not, it should be deleted.


PER 3043:

	This has something to do with an attached printer; is it VMS-only?


PER 3050:

	This has something to do with a Transaction Processing problem with
	local arrays.  VMS-only or applicable to Unix too?



PER 3150:

	Tests whether boolean disrupts subsequent naked reference.


PER 3313:

	Tests division bug fix.
