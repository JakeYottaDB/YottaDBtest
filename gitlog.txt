    [argumentless rundown][KISHORE][nars] move subtests that do argumentless rundown to a test on its own, in manually_start suite
    
    argumentless rundowns cause frequent test failures now that orphaned ipcs are easily created in the E_ALL
    when $gtm_db_counter_sem_incr > 1. So move all such tests to manually start suite
    
    Other changes:
    mupip/u_inref/mu_rundown_no_ipcrm1.csh
    rundown_argless/u_inref/mu_rundown_no_ipcrm1.csh
    	The rundown_argless version is an exact copy of the existing mupip version. Just that,
    	rundown_argless/u_inref/mu_rundown_no_ipcrm1.csh always pick the argumentless rundown path and
    	mupip/u_inref/mu_rundown_no_ipcrm1.csh always pick the rundown -reg "*" path
    
    v54003/u_inref/callerid.csh
    v54003/u_inref/shmsemremlog.csh
    	There is no reason to do argumentless rundown
    
    v60000/u_inref/C9B12001861.csh
    	grep for messages only related to the current test by looking for current work directory
    	(Not directly related to argumentless rundown)
    
    Test:
    The below tests passed once (with replic if applicable) on all servers
    mupip
    rundown_argless
    v54003
    v60000
    v60001
    v60002
    v62000
    
    The below passed once on all servers, after the grep fix

    	Summary of a few of the changes :
    	gtcm_gnp/inref/gtcm.m :
    		DRD can vary when gtm_poollimit is set. Filter it out.
    
    	replic_compress/u_inref/repltrans2big.csh :
    		TSTART/TCOMMIT shouldn.t be run from a heredoc, as that can be error-prone.
    
    	spanning_regions/u_inref/mixgld.csh:
    		When poollimit is set, the transactions are expected to restart.
    
    	v60003/inref/gtm7614.m:
    		Instead of relying on accessing the global variables (as the process can be in deadlock),
    			store the PIDs in files.
    
    	v60003/u_inref/gtm7614.csh:
    		We cannot be relying on which process will have its lock released from the deadlock situation,
    			so don't use the globals for PIDs and read from the files instead.
    Test:
    	Ran D_ALL after enabling poollimit settings in do_random_settings.csh

    GTM-8546 [ROG][nars] modify op_lock2.c to not release crit and issue a different message when it fails to get a lock in an in-crit TP retry
    
    Release note:
        LOCK (and ZALLOCATE) issue a LOCKTIMINGINTP warning message to the syslog when a process fails
        to acquire a LOCK within a critical resource holding retry of a TP transaction. Unlike TPNOTACID
        warnings, which signal the release of critical resource, LOCKTIMINGINTP does not indicate a
        release of resources. Such a LOCK must have a timeout less than gtm_tpnotacidtime or its default
        of two (2) seconds, which should limit the duration of the resource blockage it causes; a timeout
        of 0 (zero) prevents this warning. Note that FIS recommends avoiding the use of LOCK commands
        within TP transactions. Previously the described condition produced a TPNOTACID warning with its
        accompanying release of resources, which made the transaction more likely to make repeated
        restarts. (GTM-8546)
    
        LOCKTIMINGINTP, A LOCK at pppp within a TP transaction is waiting in a final TP retry,
        which may lead to a general response gap
    
        Run Time Warning: This message indicates that a LOCK  command at location pppp with a non-zero (0)
        or no timeout and within a critical resource holding retry of a TP transaction is waiting to
        acquire a resource currently owned by another process. This condition may cause other processes
        to pause for perceptible periods. The associated LOCKIS message identifies the LOCK resource name.
    
        Action: Examine the application, especially at pppp, for pathological use of LOCKs within TP.
        A zero (0) timeout prevents this warning. Note that FIS recommends avoiding the use of LOCK
        commands within TP transactions.
    
     Test:
        Rework v60000/gtm7327 to verify the change
        tweaked v62000/gtm8070 to accomdate the altered LOCK behavior
        Ran a D_ALL which founf gtm8070 - other failures seem to be due to out-of-date stuff

    * Ran -dry options for v63000a with pro and it passed. It failed reliably without the fix.
    * Ran v63000a/gtm8538 test 10 times on all boxes and it passed with the fixes. Whereas it failed a total of
    	5 times (4 with "Permission denied" and 1 with extra NOMORESEMCNT error from another concurrent test) without.
    * Ran v60003/wcs_flu subtest once to verify it passes.
    
    README:
    -------
    1) This test cannot run in pro as it relies on gtm_db_counter_sem_incr > 1 so disable pro runs
    2) Wait for source server to be done with writing to the replication instance file before making it read-only.
    3) grep for NOMORESEMCNT messages only from current test (not from other concurrently running tests).
    4) While fixing the grep issue (#3), noticed an existing wcs_flu_fail_non_standalone.csh could benefit from
    	a similar change (no usage of pipes or backquote).

    GTM-4759 [AS] [rog] Restoring NEW'ed bogus $ZGBLDIR should not cause errors
    
    Previously, NEW'ing $zgbldir that was inaccessible would cause problems
    when GT.M tried to restore it during stack unwind.

    Release Note:
    GT.M is silent about implicitly assigning the current global directory
    to a value that identifies an inaccessible file. Note that attempting to
    use such a value for a global directory continues to produce a
    ZGBLDIRACC error. Previously, with such a $ZGBLDIR value, a QUIT after a
    NEW $ZGBLDIR resulted in a STACKOFLOW error and an external reference
    produced an inappropriate ZGBLDIRACC error. (GTM-4759)

    GTM-8538 [NARS] [duzang] Move counter-halted fields from db/instance file header to shared memory
    
    Test:
    -----
    New v63001/gtm8538 subtest created. Passes with the code fixes and fails reliably with REPLINSTOPEN without code fixes.
    Multiple D_ALLs done to ensure no regressions.
    
    README
    -------
    The halted fields are moved from the file header to shared memory. This meant some error scenarios could leave the
    ftok semaphore around. These errors include BADDBVER, CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILED, DBENDIAN and VERMISMATCH errors. All
    tests which produced these errors have been fixed to rundown the ftok semaphore explicitly.
    
    The RESRCWAIT message from DSE and LKE goes to the syslog (instead of to stderr). All tests which could produce
    this output have been fixed to take this into account.
    
    In addition, fix tests that rely on the halted fields (tests which rely on the DSE DUMP -FILE -ALL or
    MUPIP REPLIC -SOURCE -JNLPOOL -SHOW output OR tests which do PEEKBYNAME of sgmnt_data.ftok_counter_halted etc.)
    to take into account the new halted fields.
    
    And create new v63001/gtm8538 subtest to test that the 32K overflow on the instance file can happen fine with
    a process that has read-only access to the replication instance file.

    [GTM-8539] [MAIMONEB] [partridger] Epoch taper should only do one fsync per epoch
    
    Release Note:
    With epoch tapering enabled, GT.M issues a single fsync in preparation
    for an epoch; previously it could issue a number of fsyncs prior to the
    epoch. This issue was only observed in the GT.M development environment,
    and was never reported by a user. (GTM-8539)
    
    Test:
    Manually verified that epoch tapering issued only one fsync per epoch.
    Ran new test on all test servers in dbg and pro.
    Ran a D_ALL.

    On some platforms, ls occasionally returns an error status if it is unable to get details on one file even if there

    to enumerate files. Do some additional cleanup while here.

    	D_ALL x4 on servers, only preexisting failures.

    [GTM-8137][KISHORE][gary] unset gtm_db_counter_sem_incr since it causes hangs
    
    This test manually does an instance freeze and then expects a checkhealth to succeed.
    But a checkhealth happens to cause the overflow if gtm_db_counter_sem_incr value is 4K or 8K
    (also depends on the number of helpers randomly chosen)
    And so that needs to flush the overflow to the db file header which will hang because the instance is frozen
    Hence disabling gtm_db_counter_sem_incr for this subtest if run in replic mode
    
    Test:
    A replay of settings from a hung test hung without the fix, but passed with the fix

    [encryption][KISHORE][nars] rely on the presence/absence of gpg-agent to set gtm_gpg_use_agent
    
    is_gpg_agent needs to kill the running agent and it causes test failures, if the agent is being used by other tests
    add encr_env subtest to rare failures pointing to <gtm_gpg_use_agent>
    
    Test:
    by running -t mpt -encrypt on all servers,
    compared the gtm_gpg_use_agent on all servers with the existing scheme and the new scheme. They were same
    
    encryption/encr_env subtest which fails if gtm_gpg_use_agent is not correctly set passed 20 times on the below servers
    duzang bolt thermo scylla
    
    forced a failure of encr_env subtest on duzang. encr_env.diff pointed to <gtm_gpg_use_agent>

    Even in that case if $gtm_verno is < V61000 spanning regions file should not be used or generated.

    noV4 [AS] [kishoreh] Improve version checking in set_gtm_machtype;If noV4, tests should recognize this case and exit
    
    com/set_gtm_machtype.csh
    - Make the setting for gtm_platform_no_V4, gtm_platform_no_ds_ver and
      gtm_test_nopriorgtmver GT.M version dependant and not platform
      checking dependant. This avoids needless updates to this file.
    - We don't have a test for gtm_platform_no_4byte_utf8, so the test is
      still based on platform
    - Remove stuff for old platforms
    
    com/gtmtest.csh
    - 64bittn no longer requires an exclusion because of the changes in
      set_gtm_machtype.csh
    
    64bittn/instream.csh
    endiancvt/instream.csh
    - If no V4 version found, setenv gtm_platform_no_V4 and let the tests
      continue. While the latest changes to set_gtm_machtype make this
      impossible, doing this lets the subtests pass while alerting us to a
      configuration problem.

    GTM-8530 [AS] [maimoneb] ZSYSTEM works even when $SHELL is null
    
    If $SHELL is defined as the null string at process startup, ensure that
    ZSYSTEM uses /bin/sh. Fix the regression introduced in GTM-8112.
    
    sr_port/op_zsystem.c
    - Eliminate the off-by-one that caused the bug in GTM-8530.
    - Instead of strcat()'ing " -c '" onto the end of $SHELL, append it
      directly either when copying the literal or snprintf() it onto $SHELL
      because the string is null terminated.
    
    sr_port/gtm_string.h
    - STRNCPY for string literals
    
    Release Note:
    If the SHELL environment variable is undefined at MUMPS start-up or if
    an external call unsets the SHELL enviroment variable, the ZSYSTEM
    command uses /bin/sh to execute the command. Previously, if the SHELL
    environment variable is undefined at MUMPS start-up, the ZSYSTEM command
    would not work. In GT.M V6.3-000, if an external call unset the SHELL
    environment variable, only the first ZSYSTEM call would work. These
    problems were never reported by users and were only seen in the GT.M
    development environment. (GTM-8530)

    [GTM-8137][KISHORE][nars] fixes to CRYPTKEYFETCH failures on scylla and bolt being used as multi-host buddies ; other followup fixes
    
    General fixes :
    dbcreate_base.csh : print mupip create output if it fails. This would show up in the failure mail
    		    and right where the failure is and help in debugging faster
    getoper.csh       : wait for absolute timeout duration (600 seconds) instead of a hardcoded 5 second sleep 120 times.
    		    This is becuase, other activities like journalctl, awk, grep, unzip etc itself would take its time
    		    and a 120 times 5 second sleep on top of that would result in waiting a lot more than 600 seconds
    
    Encryption failure related fixes :
    create_user_*			: add sticky bit ; also print in debuglog only when some activity is done
    multihost_encrypt_settings.csh	: cd to the test output directory to prevent files being created in the home directory
    reset_gpg_agent.csh		: kill9 might not be defined when this script is invoked on the remote side before proper setup
    submit_test.csh			: directly create actual test directory instead of top level test output directory.
    				  This is required for multihost_encrypt_settings.csh to place encryption debug logs in there
    				  at this point. The test directory used to get created at later stage previously
    				  leaving the debug logs in the home directory.
    subtest_helperlogs.csh 		: source the environment, as $tst_keep_output was never seen and so it never created
    				  syslog extract when a test was run with -keep option.
    				  unconditionally copy $ipcslog, as it keeps changing for every subtest
    				  copy pinentry log to the subtest outptut directory if applicable
    
    Test:
    dbreate_base.csh : Forced an encryption failure(without fix to reset_gpg_agent.csh below) and saw CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILED
    		   right on top of the failure mail, which wouldn't be there without the fix.
    getoper.csh : Not tested specifically to verify max-timeout. A passed D_ALL ensured it didn't break anything
    
    create_user_* : /tmp/{gnupgdir,relinkdir}/e1068212 had sticky bit and rm -rf /tmp/gnupgdir/e1068212 failed as gtmtest
    multihost_encrypt_settings.csh : gpg_agent_check.out and gpg_agent_reset* files were not left behind in ~
    reset_gpg_agent.csh : -encrypt -multihost test on bolt when gpg-agent was not running on scylla already passed
    		      without the fix, this test would consistently fail
    subtest_helperlogs.csh :  a) $ggdata/..../<test>.ipcs had Before/After ipcs listing of all subtests.
    			     Without the fix, it has Before/After ipcs of just the first subtest
    			  b) subtest directory had syslog extract (and pinentry log) of passed subtest run with -k
    			     Without the fix, syslog extract didn't exist if the subtest passed
    
    two D_ALLs passed

      side will terminate as soon as the gtm7522d job on the primary exits.
      This is not always true as a FREEZE on the suppl side could delay the
      propagation of the SET ^stop=1. In such a situation, the dbcheck would
      fail on the suppl side. Fix this by waiting for the backgrounded
      gtm7522d job to exit

    GTM-8523 [NARS] [roger] Add white-box testcase to exercise GTM-8523 scenario more frequently
    
    Test:
    -----
    D_ALL ran fine. New v63001/gtm8523 test ran fine on all servers with dbg & pro.
    New v63001/gtm8523 test failed with SIG-11 if run with the new white-box code but without the
    	1-line fix ("stop_ptr = array") in fix_updarray_and_oldblock_ptrs() (op_tcommit.c).
    
    README:
    -------
    The test creates the following scenario.
    
    Process executing parent^gtm8523 goes to op_tcommit() with a block to be allocated and decides to
    call bm_getfree()/gdsfilext() because it notices there are no free blocks (init^gtm8523 takes care
    of this part). It then makes sure an online backup is running at the same time (this is taken care
    of by enabling the white-box test case which ensures the right ordering by sleeping as needed) and
    in addition also ensures that the free block that bm_getfree() allocates is a block that this same
    process has modified as part of this same transaction (i.e. this is a restartable situation but the
    process does not know this yet until it goes to tp_tend()). On top of this, the white-box code
    ensures this process does not do the actual file extension but instead spawns off another process
    which executes child^gtm8523 and does the file extension. This causes the parent process to go
    through fix_updarray_and_oldblock_ptrs() where the code responsible for GTM-8523 issue lies.

    GTM-8137 [KISHORE,NARS] [nars,kishore] Exercise counter semaphore overflow in E_ALL; Related & Misc other test fixes
    
    Test:
    -----
    New dbg-only env var gtm_db_counter_sem_incr has been set to 16K, 8K and 4K randomly (in addition to being unset,
    the default). Dozens of E_ALLs have been run with these settings to exercise counter-overflow scenarios in various
    ways. And issues found have been fixed.
    
    README:
    -------
    The main change is to introduce a dbg-only env var gtm_db_counter_sem_incr that controls how much a process bumps
    the counter semaphore every time it references the database and/or replication instance file. This is set to one
    of 4K, 8K, 16K or 0 (undefined) if gtm_test_qdbrundown is also randomly chosen by the test framework.  This
    exercises the counter semaphore code a lot more in the E_ALL than before. Note that if gtm_test_qdbrundown is 0,
    then this artificial bump cannot be turned on as the test would then issue CRITSEMFAIL/ENO34 errors due to overflows.
    
    The artificial counter overflow also leaves ipcs which need to be cleaned up by the test. A new framework
    script can_ipcs_be_leftover.csh determines if this is a test where ipcs can be left over due to the artificial
    counter bump. If so, another framework script leftover_ipc_cleanup_if_needed.csh takes care of cleaning up the
    ipcs and journal files just like a test run without artificial counter bumps would have done. This ensures the
    test produces the same output whether it runs with or without the artificial counter bump. A new dbg-only qualifier
    -CLEANJNL was added to MUPIP RUNDOWN -OVERRIDE to ensure journal files are cleanly shutdown and used by the
    leftover_ipc_cleanup_if_needed.csh script.
    
    Firstly, the test framework was fixed to ensure gld is created with -qdbrundown on all regions whenever
    gtm_test_qdbrundown is enabled. This ensured no CRITSEMFAIL/ENO34 errors from database files when the counter
    overflows (due to the artificual bump). This meant fixing various tests that used hardcoded gld files to instead
    use the test_specific_gde env var scheme. That way the test framework will automatically insert the correct
    -qdbrundown commands in the gld if gtm_test_qdbrundown is enabled for that test. Any test that was using plain
    MUPIP CREATE was enhanced to additionally do a MUPIP SET -QDBRUNDOWN if gtm_test_qdbrundown is 1.
    
    Next round of fixes were to test scripts to ensure all instance files that get created use the new -QDBRUNDOWN
    qualifier whenever gtm_test_qdbrundown is 1. This ensures we do not get CRITSEMFAIL/ENO34 errors from the ftok counter
    semaphore of the replication instance files in those tests. $gtm_test_qdbrundown_parms is now passed to every instance
    file create and is set appropriately depending on gtm_test_qdbrundown env var.
    
    Then test scripts were fixed to ensure they invoke the leftover_ipc_cleanup_if_needed.csh script at the appropriate
    places. In some cases, there were tests missing a dbcheck invocation due to reasons unknown. dbcheck was added there
    which automatically took care of the ipc cleanup as well and made the test much more stricter in its checking.
    
    Cleaning up leftover ipcs using MUPIP RUNDOWN also meant we need read-write access to the database which a lot of tests
    were not guaranteeing at the time dbcheck was being invoked. Those were fixed to restore the right permissions before
    the dbcheck invocation or if it was not easily possible to fix the permissions the DBRDONLY errors from MUPIP RUNDOWN
    were explicitly filtered out (e.g. read_only/singlereg and read_only/multireg).
    
    In addition, there were a few tests whose output was different depending on whether counter chosen as 16K or 8K or 4K.
    The test scripts and/or reference filese were fixed in those tests to work in all cases.
    
    Also, the test framework used to turn off replication on the databases as part of RF_SHUT by default. This posed
    problems with leftover ipcs. It was a longstanding annoyance that had to be addressed now. So the framework was
    changed to turn off replication ONLY if explicitly requested. The default behavior is to keep replication on.
    This resulted in fixes to LOTs of reference files ("Will turn replication off" text no longer appears as part of
    the dbcheck output). In addition, a few test scripts had to be fixed due to this change. For example, the collation
    test was doing global sets (^prefix=1) after having done a RF_SHUT which was fine before since replication was turned
    off but now required the journal pool to be up (since replication is still on). Thankfully those sets were duplicate
    sets and so could be removed without change to the test flow. Another example is scripts which were looking for
    mumps.mjl_* were changed to mumps.mjl because there is no journal file switch (due to turning off replication).
    
    There were a few tests where the artificial counter bump had to be disabled (e.g. white-box tests whose flow was
    affected etc.).
    
    Various tests invoked dbcheck with a specific database file name (e.g. "dbcheck.csh mumps"). Those were fixed to
    just do dbcheck.csh as this does a MUPIP RUNDOWN -REG "*" which also runs down the journal pool ipcs whereas the
    former only does a MUPIP RUNDOWN -FILE mumps.dat which is not enough in case ipcs are left over due to the artificial
    counter bump.
    
    The MUPIP REPLIC -EDITINST -SHOW output printed a new line "HDR Quick database rundown is active" to indicate whether
    QDBRUNDOWN is enabled on the replication instance file or not. This meant fixing reference files to various tests.
    
    A few tests were modified to accept both "File already open by another process" and "File is in use by another process".
    The former output is obtained when mu_rndwn_file() tries to get standalone access by waiting for the counter semaphore
    to become 0 with the IPC_NOWAIT qualifier and finds the counter is non-zero. But with the counter overflow situation
    created artificially (and randomly) by the test framework, it is possible processes that bumped the counter before
    the overflow have exited and processes that started after the counter had overflown did not bump the counter at all
    but are still accessing the database. This means the IPC_NOWAIT command could succeed in the counter-overflow case.
    But later mu_rndwn_file() checks if there are any processes attached to the database shared memory and finds a non-zero
    value and then it issues a different error message which is the latter output above. So allow both choices.
    
    Miscellaneous changes
    	--> mupip_disallow subtest had changes due to new MUPIP REPLIC -EDIT -QDBRUNDOWN
    	--> mupip/musetchk subtest now does a stricter check of parsing the DSE DUMP -FILE output.
    		Previously it would pass even if could not parse out the desired fields from the DSE DUMP -FILE output.
    	--> Move code that was duplicated in various places to a new framework script disable_settings_msr_priorver.csh.
    	--> v63000/gtm8137 subtest was previously testing the counter semaphore overflow scenario using a white-box.
    		Now that the E_ALL does that, and that test has a lot of timing issues, it was reworked so it only
    		tests the functionality aspect of counter-overflow (i.e. halted fields are displayed when overflow
    		occurs etc.).
    	--> dbcreate.csh : modified to accept -lock_space as a parameter
    	--> set_encrypt_env.csh : modified to place gtm_pinentry_log in $GNUPGHOME instead of in the test
    		output directory
    	--> view_instancefiles.csh : modified to accept fields to ignore/mask off. This was required since instance
    		file flush could happen at random places due to counter semaphore overflow randomness which meant
    		fields like "HDR Journal Sequence Number" could have different values based on $gtm_db_counter_sem_incr
    	--> lke1.csh : With an 8K counter bump, LKE turns out to be the process that causes the access control semaphore
    		to overflow (source server bumps counter to 8K, main mumps process bumps to 16K, jobbed off mumps
    		process bumps to 24K making the next LKE command bump it to 32K and cause an overflow), then it would
    		print a RESRCWAIT message and then continue getting the access control semaphore lock. So filter out
    		any GTM-I-RESRCWAIT message from the test output.
    	--> locks/multi_user_lock subtest : GTMSECSHRPERM message is not duplicated with GTM-8137 code fixes. And
    		NOTALLDBRNDWN message is additionally printed. Adjust reference file accordingly.
    	--> v60001/gtm7538 subtest : MUINSTFROZEN is expected from the checkhealth command if db shm was cleanly
    		rundown but journal pool is around in a frozen state. But in case of counter overflows, db shm is
    		left over and so MUINSTFROZEN is not expected. Rework test to exercise both scenarios.

    GTM-8511 [AS] [rog] DSE should not error out if it can avoid it
    
    GTM-8137 introduced some new logic when coupled with a WB test case to
    set the semaphore counter to 16k caused DSE to flush the file header to
    disk. The dse/dse_change subtest fails in this case because it did not
    expect the file header to be flushed during testing.
    
    To work around this issue, four new fields were added to NL to retain
    the values used to initialize shared memory. These fields are set during
    shared memory initialization by all GT.M programs. DSE however is the
    only that uses these fields to ensure that it can operate correctly.
    
    The protection for access method is not complete. Switching between the
    two proves fatal to any GT.M operation that checks csd->acc_meth. For
    instance secshr_db_clnup() ASSERT fails after forcibly changing access
    method using DSE.
    
    Testing uses DSE's file header change by location facility. For
    instance:
    	$gtm_dist/dse change -f -declo=12  -value=200
    Offsets are computed using $cms_tools/offset.sh like so:
    	> $cms_tools/offset.sh sgmnt_data | awk '/\.(acc_meth|(blk|lock_space|jnl_buffer)_size)/'
    		offset = 0012 [0x000c]      size = 0004 [0x0004] ----> sgmnt_data.blk_size
    		offset = 0028 [0x001c]      size = 0004 [0x0004] ----> sgmnt_data.acc_meth
    		offset = 0056 [0x0038]      size = 0004 [0x0004] ----> sgmnt_data.lock_space_size
    		offset = 0904 [0x0388]      size = 0004 [0x0004] ----> sgmnt_data.jnl_buffer_size
    With the exception of DSE change -fileheader -blk_size, the other file
    header changes are not exposed via DSE.

    [GTM-8506] Fix crit deadlock while fetching trigger source
    
    This set of changes fixes an issue from a recent test failure where a fatal error in a trigger caused
    a deadlock condition. The reason for this was the process held crit in a region needed by another process
    and that process needed the lock we had. Usually this is no problem but with the trigger failure, error
    handling goes out and fetches the source for all routines on the M stack. But fetching source for a trigger
    involves getting crit and the crit we needed was held by the other process - instant deadlock.
    
    The fix was to add -EMBED_SOURCE to trigger compiles so the source is always available. This change has
    a significant effect on on what happens when one uses $TEXT() or ZPRINT on a trigger. Previously a mini-transaction
    was created to fetch the source from the database but now, if the trigger is loaded, we use whatever source is
    inside the trigger without checking if it is the most recent possible trigger. This largely mirrors how $TEXT()
    works for regular routines when auto-relink is not in effect.
    
    The initial plan was to rewrite/rename the trigger_source_load_andor_verify() routine to do this but it turned
    out op_setzbrk.c still needed to run the old way so that routine was left alone and a new trigger_locate_andor_load()
    routine was created instead that shares many pieces with trigger_source_load_andor_verify() but with all the
    transactional context removed. If the trigger is not loaded, trigger_locate_andor_load() calls the old routine
    to load it. This form does require a transactional fence but this is not an issue for the original problem because
    that only ever potentially occurs with routines on the M stack so the trigger would have to be loaded for that
    to be true.
    
    Lastly, the trigger_source_load_andor_verify() routine used to have a flag on which type of load was requested but
    the flag is now removed as it is no longer needed for the minimal uses it now has.
    
    Routines modified:
    
    sr_port/op_setbrk.c:
    - Removed the flag from the trigger_source_read_andor_verify() call.
    
    sr_port/op_zprint.c:
    - Removed a superfluous setting of "is_trigger" as it is re-set 3 lines down and not used prior to that.
    
    sr_unix/get_source_line.c
    - Remove dependencies on trigger descriptor resident source buffer and how it creates the buffer - use imbedded
      source buffer instead.
    - Change name of routine to call - change to trigger_locate_andor_load().
    - Add assert that embedded source is available.
    
    sr_unix/gtm_trigger.c
    - Changes to add -EMBED_SOURCE option to trigger compile command line.
    
    sr_unix/trigger_locate_andor_load.c
    - New routine to fetch trigger source from embedded buffer for loaded triggers without a transaction else to
      load trigger.
    
    sr_unix/trigger_read_andor_locate.h
    - Renamed from trigger_source_read_andor_verify() since it now covers both trigger source read modules.
    - Also adds declaration for trigger_locate_andor_load() routine.
    
    sr_unix/trigger_source_read_andor_verify.c
    - Moved macros and definitions to header file.
    - Changes to remove source load type flag from internal routines.
    - Minor standards changes.
    
    These changes also greatly affected certain of the test:
    1. The trigthrash routine had a comparison in it verifying that the trigger (under TP) at the start of a transaction
       was the same trigger when the trigger was eventually driven. This failed at times because merrily fetching trigger
       source with ZPRINT or $TEXT() took whatever source was in the currently loaded trigger (or it loaded the trigger)
       without verifying it was current.
    2. The gtm8389 test had a heavy dependence on the trigger source check so the current content was trimmed yet several
       new cases were added to test triggers and unlink.
    3. Note that a manual test was created that checks that the original trigger source fetch leading to deadlock issue
       was fixed. This case is detailed at the end of this note as it is a little large-ish. Since it hangs even with the
       fix (but in a different place proving the fix), making an automated test case out of it is prohibitive
       (i.e. we dunno how to make one)
    
    Test files changes:
    
    triggers/inref/gtm8389.m:
    - Restructured to allow the embedded source of the currently loaded trigger to work.
    - 4 new cases added dealing with unlink (unloads triggers).
    
    triggers/inref/trigthrash2.m:
    - Rework trigger number equality check to only do it for ZBREAK allowing mismatches for $TEXT() and ZPRINT.
    
    triggers/outref/gtm8389.txt
    - Changes to reflect changes in gtm8389.m
    
    Release Note:
    GT.M no longer deadlocks on certain fatal errors. Previously, when a trigger caused a fatal error, under certain
    condititions, this could cause a critical section deadlock. This issue was discovered in internal test and has never
    been reported by a customer. (GTM-8506)
    
    Test:
    - Ran multiple D_ALLs.
    - Specifically ran triggers test dozens and dozens of times.
    
    Following is a manual test for this issue that uses a manual test case but it is not suitable for automation as
    even this with this fix this test case hangs - just in a different place (hangs in gds_rundown instead of when
    fetching trigger source):
    -------
    As discussed, I verified with a manual testcase that this happens.
    
    In one terminal run "source restart" and wait for this to hang. At that point in another terminal run "source
    restart1.csh". And then in yet another terminal do "dse crit -all" and you will see two processes holding crit
    and hung because of the deadlock. With the fixes for GTM-8500, dse crit -all shows only AREG holding crit within
    15 seconds or so whereas without the fixes it stays that way for ever.
    
    Recording the testcase below just in case we need it later.

    gtm7160 [AS] [duzang] More DSE adjustments
    
    This test failed over the weekend in PRO. While looking at the test
    again, I realized that the M routine already controls the output. grep
    exclusions were moved from CSH back into the M routine. Additional
    sanitization was implemented to keep the noise down. The values of DSE
    don't matter for this test. All that matters is that %DSEWRAP can read
    DSE's output. Extra sanitization had the side effect of reducing the
    need to TEST_AWK the reference file.

    [misc][KISHORE][bill] do_m_filtering.csh: place utilobj dir ahead of others ; inref.csh: source the environment from test output directory
    
    do_m_filtering.csh : The idea of having utilobj directory is to place the object files used by this tool there,
    		     so place that directory ahead of others
    inref.csh : is called only by unite.csh which needs test output directory to run.
    	    It is better to get entire test related environment from env.txt than setting them individually
    dbcreate.csh : These are newer environment variables that need to be set to their default values
    	       for dbcreate to work if called outside the test system
    
    Test:
    do_m_filtering.csh : A couple of D_ALLs part of testing other changes
    inref.csh : Simple unite.csh worked
    dbcreate.csh : dbcreate call outside test system works only with the changes.

    GTM-8502 [NARS] [kishore,roger] MUPIP commands that need standalone access should issue MUUSERLBK/MUUSERECOV errors just like explicit MUPIP RUNDOWN
    
    Test:
    ------
    Existing E_ALL failed various tests. Those have been fixed to reflect the new behavior.
    D_ALL passes clean with the code/test changes.
    
    README:
    -------
    * test/crash_fail/u_inref/src_crash_fo.csh
    * test/crash_fail/outref/src_crash_fo.txt
    	--> Backward recovery on nobefore-image journaled replicated database with a crashed journal file
    	--> issues a MUUSERLBK error now (not a JNLNOBIJBACK error like before). Also, when restoring from
    	--> backup, make sure the crashed journal file is moved away and a clean one from the time of the
    	--> backup put back in.
    
    * test/forw_rollback/u_inref/verify.csh
    * test/forw_rollback/outref/verify.txt
    	--> Backward recovery on replicated database with a crashed journal file issues a MUUSERLBK error
    	--> Adjust test accordingly to test this new behavior and continue to test -VERIFY behavior like before.
    
    * test/forw_rollback/u_inref/misc_quals.csh
    	--> Use -BYPAS in MUPIP SET -JNLFILE command to avoid needing standalone access as that would now
    	--> issue a MUUSERLBK error.
    
    * test/v62000/u_inref/gtm8121.csh
    * test/v62000/outref/gtm8121.txt
    	--> After crash of database, run rollback to fix crashed journal files before restarting source server
    	--> and invoking dbcheck.csh as the latter does a MUPIP SET -REPLICATION=OFF which needs standalone access
    	--> and that would get a MUUSERLBK error if a crashed journal file still exists.
    
    * test/v60003/u_inref/wcs_flu_fail_standalone.csh*
    * test/v60003/outref/wcs_flu_fail.txt
    	--> A MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER FORWARD on a crashed nobefore-image journaled database issues a MUUSERECOV error
    	--> instead of the JNLORDBFLU error for a before-image journaled database. Also the JNLFILOPN error does not
    	--> show up in the nobefore-image journaled case because the MUUSERECOV error happens much before that part
    	--> of the code is reached. Adjust test script and reference file accordingly.
    	--> Also did not see a reason for the 5 second sleep in each of the 4 cases (1 standalone and 3 non-standalone)
    	--> The test does not remove shared memory anyways so the update is still around even if the process dies.
    	--> And removing the 5 second sleep reduces test runtime by 20 seconds at least.

    Both subtests expect the minimum of two resync values at the end, and was trying to force
    one of them to be the minimum, but system issues make that impossible. Instead, figure out
    which is the minimum and check against that.
    
    Test:
    Ran dual_fail/dual_fail[56] 8x on "all duzang shrug thermopylae rajamanin cronem bahirs"

    [BASE][kishoreh] Protect failure due to concurrent argumentless MUPIP RUNDOWN while the journal pool is up.
    This test kills all the processes who are attached to the journal pool. A concurrent argumentless rundown may remove
    the journal pool before this test does. It causes this test to fail. Skip the portion of the test that expects the
    journal pool if that happens.
    
    Test:
    Ran on all servers.
    On base, added a sleep right after the kill. While the test is on sleep, ran a concurrent argumentless rundown from
    another terminal to verify the test still passes.

    [GTM-8480][kunal][kishoreh] MUPIP BACKUP should reduce the size of the backup
    Release Note:
    	MUPIP BACKUP DATABASE now attempts to preserve, and potentially restore, sparseness in database files.
    	Previously, MUPIP BACKUP DATABASE resulted in backup databases that were fully allocated.
    	In the case of large but sparse database files, this could produce backup database files that used substantially
    	  more storage than the original database files.
    	To remove sparseness from backup database files, use the fallocate command on Linux,
    	  or copy them to another location using the cp command on AIX. (GTM-8480)
    
    Test:
    	Modified the existing subtests under "mupip" to check whether the size of backup is more than the size of DB.
    	Ran the "mupip" test multiple times on all servers.
    	Regression check:
    		Ran "online_bkup" and "mupip" tests on all servers.
    		(The tests fail with V990, as expected).

    [misc][KISHORE][nars] DBMRKBUSY are expected when rollbacks happen. dbcheck_filter.csh filters them out
    
    The test does a LOT of switchovers and expects fetchresync rollbacks to happen along the way.
    In that case, we cannot do a dbcheck. We need to do a dbcheck_filter which will ignore DBMRKBUSY errors.
    Those are possible after any rollback that takes the database back in time
    (in case a KILL record got written before an EPOCH but its corresponding INCTN records got written after the EPOCH
    and that epoch happened to be the turn-around point for the rollback).

    "multi_proc_key" is set to NULL at the start of Phase2 in mur_forward.c but never set to correspond to
    the current region when a journal record is played. This can cause the region name prefix to not be
    printed in pro and cause assert failures in dbg (in UTIL_OUTPUT.C) if for example a FILERENAME message
    is about to be printed due to a journal file autoswitch in Phase2 of journal recovery. This is now fixed
    to initialize multi_proc_key by setting it in "mur_forward_play_cur_jrec" a central function that is also
    invoked by "mur_forward_play_multireg_tp" so separate initialization is not needed in the latter.
    
    Release Note:
    --------------
    N/A. This is a fix to an issue in unreleased code.
    
    Test:
    ------
    New subtest mupjnl/autoswitch_in_mupjnl has been created. It reliably fails without the fix and passes with
    the fix. D_ALL also run to ensure no regressions.

    be NEW'ed
    
    Release Note:
    The %MPIECE utility NEWs all local variables except its arguments.
    Previously it could disrupt the state of a caller's local variables. (GTM-8403)

    GTM-8034 [AS] [base] VIEW "JOBPID":1
    
    If OUTPUT and ERROR are the same file avoid the duplicate rename which
    results in an error condition. The driven M routine exposed a bug in
    waitforfilecreate.m so I fixed that as well.
    
    Release Note:
    Using VIEW "JOBPID":1 does not issue an error when the JOB command
    parameters ERROR and OUTPUT point to the same file. Previously, using
    the same file name for ERROR and OUTPUT and VIEW "JOBPID":1 resulted in
    an error. (GTM-8034)

    GTM-6310 GTM-8336 GTM-8464 GTM-8487 [SOPINI] [kishoreh] Allow on-the-fly ability to change encryption key & cipher for databases
    
    Changes for GTM-8487:
    
    * com/outref.awk
    * v52000/inref/c9h03002827.m
    * v52000/outref/C9H03002827.txt
    * v52000/u_inref/C9H03002827.csh
       --> Enhance CH03002827 subtest to account for the fact that REPLINSTNOSHM error no longer happens as long as the
           mumps process has attached to the journal pool before it opens db shm. If gtm_custom_errors is not set, then
           jnlpool_init does not happen, so we expect REPLINSTNOSHM in that case.
    
    Changes for GTM-6310, GTM-8336, and GTM-8464:
    
    1. Basic stand-alone conversion with subsequent validation:
    
       a) From unencrypted to encrypted.
       b) From encrypted with one key to encrypted with a different key.
    
       This test additionally performs the following:
    
       - Encrypting an encrypted database without first supplying the -encryptable flag should not work.
       - Ensure that MUPIP CREATE uses the last entry.
       - Notify if already encrypted with the requested key.
       - Encrypted databases continue to work with the configuration file containing either both new and old keys or just
         the new ones.
       - Regions are randomized to be either particular ones (but not necessarily all) or "*"; only the chosen regions
         should be verified for encryption status.
       - Path to the key is specified either in absolute or relative fashion, randomly.
       - Optionally uses journaling.
       - When journaling, verifies that two journal file switches occur.
       - Checks that MUREENCRYPTEND is printed in the syslog when (re)encryption is complete.
       - Databases initially using null IV switch to non-null IV after reencryption.
    
    2. Online conversion on a prefilled database with subsequent validation:
    
       a) From unencrypted to encrypted to encrypted with different keys.
       b) From encrypted to encrypted with different keys.
    
       This test additionally covers the following aspects:
    
       - All operations may be done on up to five regions.
       - One region may be referenced by multiple names.
       - Verify that a process may start before the (re)encryption begins or after the first pass has completed.
       - Multiple (re)encryptions are peformed back-to-back.
       - After (re)encryption completes, all concurrent MUMPS processes are able to use the database.
    
    3. Errors:
    
       a) Specified key is not found in the configuration file.
       b) Specified key corresponds to a different database.
       c) Operation attempted in MM.
       d) Read-only database.
       e) Concurrent MUPIP REORG ENCRYPTs.
       f) Incompatible REORG qualifiers.
       g) Attempt to resume (re)encryption with a different key.
       h) Attempt to resume (re)encryption after the key has been removed.
       i) Attempt to mark encryption complete during an ongoing MUPIP REORG ENCRYPT.
       j) Consecutive MUPIP REORG ENCRYPTs without marking encryption complete in between.
       k) Attempt to downgrade a partially (re)encrypted database.
       l) Attempt to make the database unencryptable in the middle of (re)encryption.
    
       This test additionally makes sure that
    
       - Basic resume works.
    
    4. Resume:
    
       a) Reencryption can be resumed upon interrupting a MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT process with a SIGINT or SIGTERM.
       b) Reencryption can be resumed after an interrupt and a subsequent MUPIP REORG (-TRUNCATE).
    
       This test randomly decides whether to
    
       - use journaling;
       - interrupt MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT processes with a SIGINT or SIGTERM;
       - invoke MUPIP REORG upon interruptions;
       - perform a database trunctation if MUPIP REORGs are done.
    
    5. Backup:
    
       a) Backup version has been upgraded to 7.
       b) (Re)encryption can be performed while MUPIP BACKUP is underway.
       c) Backup that started before (re)encryption commenced can be restored with only the original key in configuration
          file.
       d) MUPIP BACKUP can be performed while the database is being (re)encrypted.
       e) Backup that started after (re)encryption commenced can only be restored with both keys present in configuration
          file.
       f) MUPIP RESTORE cannot be performed while the database is being (re)encrypted.
    
       This test optionally
    
       - uses journaling; and
       - starts with an unencrypted database.
    
    6. Recover:
    
       a) MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER can start while (re)encryption is in progress (except when MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT is holding
          the FTOK semaphore).
       b) MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT can start while recovery is in progress (but has to wait for MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER to
          release the FTOK semaphore).
    
       This test randomly
    
       - starts with an unencrypted database;
       - schedules recover to run after (re)encryption has finished;
       - chooses between before and nobefore journaling;
       - chooses between forward and backward recovery;
       - picks a sleep duration between the REORG and RECOVER process, whatever the order; and
       - decides whether to use -since and -before qualifiers for recovery.
    
    ------------------------------------------
    
    RELEASE NOTE:
    
    With the -ENCRYPT flag, MUPIP REORG changes the encryption key of a database, or encrypts an unencrypted database, while
    the database continues to be used by applications. Whether or not the prior encryption uses non-zero initialization
    vectors (IVs), any database blocks encrypted with the new key use non-zero IVs (see release note for GTM-8117). The
    syntax is
    
        MUPIP REORG -ENCR[YPT]=<key> -REGION <region-list>
    
    where "key" is a key provided by MUPIP to the encryption plugin. The reference implementation of the plugin expects a
    key with the specified name in the encryption configuration file identified by $gtmcrypt_config. For each database file
    mapping to one of the regions specified, there must be an entry in the database section of the configuration file that
    names the specified key as its key. The -ENCRYPT flag is incompatible with all other command line flags of MUPIP REORG,
    and performs no operation other than to change the encryption key. If the specified key is already the encryption key of
    a database region, MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT moves on the next region after displaying a message (on stderr, where MUPIP
    operations send their output).
    
    MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT switches the journal file for each database region when it begins operating on it, and again when
    it completes, and also records messages in the syslog for both events. Note that the detailed journal extract format is
    now level 8.
    
    Since a database file will have two keys, at least while MUPIP REORG is underway to change the key, the database section
    of the configuration file provides for a single database file entry to specify multiple keys. For example, if there are
    database regions CUST and HIST, mapping to database files cust.dat and hist.dat in directory /var/myApp/prod, whose keys
    are to be changed from key1 to key2, using the command:
    
        MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT=key2 -REGION CUST,HIST
    
    the database section of the configuration file must at least have the following entries:
    
        database: {
            keys: ({
                dat: "/var/myApp/cust.dat";
    	    key: "key1";
    	},{
    	    dat: "/var/myApp/cust.dat";
    	    key: "key2";
    	},{
    	    dat: "/var/myApp/hist.dat";
    	    key: "key1";
    	},{
    	    dat: "/var/myApp/hist.dat";
    	    key: "key2";
    	})
        };
    
    In other words, each database file entry can have multiple keys, and of course, each key can be associated with multiple
    database files. With a configuration file that has multiple keys associated with the same database file, MUPIP CREATE
    uses the last entry. Other database operations use whichever key has a hash matching one in the database file header,
    reporting an error if no key matches. To improve efficiency when opening databases, you can delete entries for keys that
    are no longer used from the configuration file.
    
    An online encryption of an unencrypted database is only possible if the database has been previously marked
    "encryptable" using the following command:
    
        MUPIP SET -ENCRYPTABLE -REGION <region-list>
    
    The command requires standalone access to the database and results in double the amount of global buffers when
    allocating shared memory, similarly to fully encrypted databases. To revert databases back to "unencryptable" state, you
    can issue
    
        MUPIP SET -NOENCRYPTABLE -REGION <region-list>
    
    The behavior of the above command, depending on what state the database is in, is as follows:
    
        - a no-op if the database is encrypted;
        - disallowed if the database is partially (re)encrypted; or
        - prohibits encryption if the database is not encrypted.
    
    Under normal operation, a database file has only one key. Upon starting a MUPIP REORG to change the key, there are two
    keys, both of whose hashes are stored in the database file header. With a MUPIP REORG operation underway to change the
    key, normal database operation can continue, except for another MUPIP REORG. Other MUPIP operations, such as MUPIP
    BACKUP and MUPIP EXTRACT can occur (blocks in a binary extract can therefore be encrypted with one of multiple keys). If
    the system crashes, a MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK / RECOVER can recover any journaled database regions (use of NOBEFORE
    journaling restricts RECOVERY / ROLLBACK to FORWARD). A MUPIP REORG operation can be resumed after an interruption,
    either unintentional, such as after a system crash and recovery, or intentional, after an explicit MUPIP STOP of the
    MUPIP REORG process. To resume the REORG operation, the original command must be issued, including the key parameter.
    (Note that supplying a key other than the one used in the original command results in an error.)
    
    After the MUPIP REORG process completes, other MUPIP REORG operations are permitted, except for another MUPIP REORG
    -ENCRYPT operation. To enable subsequent MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT operations, use the following command:
    
        MUPIP SET -ENCRYPTIONCOMPLETE -REGION <region-list>
    
    The reason to block subsequent MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT operations after completion is to provide time for a backup of the
    complete database before enabling subsequent key changes. MUPIP SET -ENCRYPTIONCOMPLETE reports an error for any
    database region for which MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT has not completed.
    
    As a string of hexadecimal digits (including any leading zeroes), $VIEW("CRYPT",<region>) displays the hash of the
    encryption key for the specified database region. If there are two different keys because a MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT
    operation is underway, the return value is two comma-separated hashes with that of the old key preceding that of the new
    key. Unencrypted database regions report a null string, which means that if a MUPIP REORG -ENCRYPT is encrypting an
    unencrypted database, the return value is a comma followed by a hash. When the region is specified as "*", the return
    value is a semi-colon separated list of hash values for all regions in alphabetic order.
    
    The above changes necessitated certain alterations of the encryption plugin API (for other API changes, refer to
    GTM-8336).
    
    (GTM-6310)
    
    GT.M raises an error if the configuration file does not contain an entry specifically mapping the key for a database
    file to that database file name. Previously, GT.M accepted any key with a matching hash, even a key that was not
    specifically mapped to the database file name. The new behavior reduces the time to initialize encryption for
    multi-region databases. This enhancement benefits from changes to the API of the encryption plugin. (GTM-8336)
    
    MUPIP EXTRACT on an encrypted database instance creates valid binary extract files regardless of the region mapping.
    Previously, MUPIP EXTRACTs on instances with multiple regions pointing to the same database file could result in invalid
    extract files, unprocessable by MUPIP LOAD. (GTM-8464)
    
    Shutting down all Source Server processes when GT.M processes are still accessing a database file does not generate
    inappropriate REPLINSTMATCH errors. (GTM-8487)

    GTM-8225 [AS] [maimoneb] AIX should try to use IBM's zlib
    
    With this change and the loss of AIX 5, there are no platforms without a
    default zlib. I deleted the original test files since there is no
    platform that does not have zlib on it by default.
    
    Release Note:
    MUPIP replication compression supports the use of the IBM provided zlib
    library for AIX. Previously MUPIP replication compression required a
    custom compiled library (GTM-8225)
    
    Test:
    Tested replic_compress/zlib_not_found on all AIX servers. It fails on
    each because MUPIP can find and use the default libz.a, so it does not
    error out. replic_compress/zlib_not_found unsetenvs LIBPATH and
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH to ensure that MUPIP cannot find the custom built
    libz.so

    GTM-8486 [AS] [rog] Increment set_zroutines_cycle after validating the new zroutines
    
    An rts_error in zro_load() would result in downstream effort to get the
    $zposition. Previously, zro_load() set set_zroutines_cycle on entry which
    meant the downstream work would incorrectly attempt to re-zlink the target
    routine(s) resulting an out-of-design situation.
    
    The test case follows the example provided by Sam Habiel.
    
    Test:

    [misc][KISHORE][amul] if a subtest passed with -st is excluded by instream.csh, report it than being silent ; do not rely on $work_dir to recompile IGS - use $gtm_test_useIGS instead
    
    Test:
    1) submit_subtest.csh:
    Without the fix, running a subtest disabled for pro would result in the below diff.log
    > cat diff.log
    2d1
    < PASS from gtm6301
    
    With the fix, the diff would be like the below
    > cat diff.log
    2c2
    < PASS from gtm6301
    ---
    > gtm6301 included in -st but EXCLUDED by instream.csh
    
    2) gtm7897.csh :
    one simple run of v62000/gtm7897 passed on bolt
    when -env gtm_test_useIGS=$gtm_com/IGS_old was passed, it failed with IGS usage (meaning it used IGS_old)

    GTM-XXXX [AS] [duzang] enforce TERM settings for sphere
    
    Enforce the TERM setting used inside screen as the default caused
    problems. After discussion with Gary, he reminded me that screen will
    always override TERM set prior to screen. That means the setenv TERM in
    expect/u_inref/terminal5.csh CSH scripts doesn't have an effect on TERM
    used inside screen. Any other test that attempts to leverage screen will
    need to consider this.
    
    Release Note:

    GTM-8296 [AS] [duzang] OSS build changes for %PEEKBYNAME
    
    %PEEKBYNAME added GTM Defined Types data into gtmhelp.dat. This change across
    all repos adds that information to the resulting open source build.
    
    gtm/
    CMakeLists.txt
    - Removed the use of GTM_BUILD_TYPE which duplicated the use of
      CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. Files that relied on this field were renamed in
      kitsource.csh to use "Release" and "Debug" in place of "pro" and "dbg"
    - Added support to read the build specific GTMDefinedTypes M routine and load
      gtmhelp.dat with the data
    
    test/
    manually_start/outref/ossmake.txt
    manually_start/u_inref/{ossmake,makebuild,testbuild}.csh
    - CMake has been the only build style for a while. Remove code that treated it
      like an option. Exit if CMake isn't found
    - Copy GTMDefinedTypesInit{Pro,Dbg}.m into the build area alongside other
      generated files using "Release" and "Debug" in place of "pro" and "dbg"
    - Add more comments for clarity
    
    tools/
    cms_tools/kitsource.csh
    - Copy GTMDefinedTypesInit{Pro,Dbg}.m from the release's $gtm_pct
    - Copy files replacing "pro" and "dbg" with "Release" and "Debug"
    
    work_tools/insert_copyright_notice.csh
    - CMakeLists's copyright was not being updated, so fix that
    
    TODO
    - Integrate GTM defined types generation into the reguolar GT.M build
    - Move ossmake back into the regular test run
    
    Release Note:

    Test:
    Tested the following across all Linux servers (AIX is still not supported by
    CMake builds)

    GTM-8476 [AS] [kishoreh] Resolve sprgde testing issues
    
    After 100+ test runs to shake out, hopefully, as much sprgde randomization
    these tests pass on all servers.
    
    Some tests have spanning region testing disabled due to the use of prior
    versions, special test specific GLDs and other corner cases like needing a
    fixed GLD to region name map.
    
    com/dbcreate.csh
    - Add default setting for gtm_test_spanreg
    
    com/gde_filter_unsupported.csh
    - Trigger upgrade tests which use prior versions must filter out spanning
      region name mapping
    
    triggers/inref/trigdefnosync.m
    - Ensure that both triggers are loaded in the same transaction. There
      was an odd race condition on the secondary where the first transaction
      crossed, but not the second and the test moved on to delete the
      second trigger using DSE.
    
    triggers/u_inref/gtm6901.csh
    triggers/u_inref/gvsuboflow.csh
    triggers/u_inref/trigcolunicode.csh
    - Test requires a specific region configuration; disable spanreg testing
    
    triggers/u_inref/trigrepl_priorver.csh
    - Test uses prior versions without spanning regions support; disable spanreg testing
    
    triggers/u_inref/gtm7509.csh
    triggers/u_inref/testxecute.csh
    - On further inspection, this test cannot use spanning regions as it expects a
      specific configuration
    
    triggers/inref/badcompile.m
    triggers/inref/compile.m
    triggers/inref/mrtn.m
    triggers/inref/piecedelimtrig.m
    triggers/inref/testxecute.m
    triggers/inref/testxecuteunicode.m
    triggers/inref/twork.m
    triggers/inref/ztriggercmd.m
    - Use $ZTNAme in place of a stack name pulled from zshow "s":stack
    - Eliminate the run-time disambiguator from $ZTNAme/stack output
    
    triggers/inref/merrorhandling.m
    triggers/inref/updateerrors.m
    triggers/u_inref/updateerrors.csh
    - Scrub the run-time disambiguator from  $ZStatus
    
    triggers/inref/gtm7522d.m
    - Some tests failed with ^%jobwait not existing on the secondary due to
      the concurrent kill on the primary. Now primary and secondary
      background processes use separate jobids to avoid conflicts. Each side
      kills its own ^%jobwait to avoid extract differences.
    
    Reference files were updated to match new output that uses $ZTNAme instead of
    $ZPOSition information from zshow "s".
    
    Release Note:
    N/A
    
    Test:
    Tested on all servers with
     -t triggers         -num_runs 10
     -t triggers         -num_runs 10 -env gtm_test_spanreg=3
     -t triggers -replic -num_runs 10
     -t triggers -replic -num_runs 10 -env gtm_test_spanreg=3
    
    Tested on thunder, bolt, shrug and thermo over 10 times replic and
    non-replic, while manually varying gtmn_test_spanreg from 0 to 3

    GTM-8460 [AS] [base,kishoreh] expect test rework and related
    
    com/pre_V54002_safe_gde.csh
    - If, for some reason, the '@' is not interpreted correctly, GDE will loop on
      input flooding the output file with the GDE> prompt. Avoid this by setting
      the input to /dev/null
    
    encryption/u_inref/file_access.csh
    - This test fuzzes the encryption setup. Redirect the pinentry log to a local
      file so this test can capture the result of its fuzzing
    
    expect/inref/rx0.csh
    expect/inref/rx0.m
    expect/outref/rx0.txt
    expect/u_inref/rx0.csh
    - I noticed that this test was taking around 1.5 minutes, which didn't
      make sense for what should be very fast. The test now runs in about 20
      seconds which is mostly test system overhead.
    - Reduced expect script timeout and improved matching. The test was
      hanging on 'expect ".* from rx0"' because the '-re' flag was not used.
    - I changed the M routine to output it's status to a clean file and
      eliminated the grep of expect output which contains ctrl-Ms in it.
    
    Move the C9K05003274 testcase from manual_tests to expect
    expect/inref/c003274.csh
    expect/inref/c003274.exp
    expect/inref/c003274.m
    expect/instream.csh
    expect/outref/C9K05003274.txt
    expect/outref/outref.txt
    expect/u_inref/C9K05003274.csh
    - The expect script spawns off the main thread and subsequent commands to
      interact with the primary invocation.
    
    expect/u_inref/maskpass_term.csh
    expect/inref/maskpassterm.m
    - Improve matching of target PID
    - Correctly wait for maskpass to start. Previously the test looped twice
      waiting to find the PID which failed occasionally
    - For debugging purposes, dump the lines read
    - Ensure that the pipe is always closed
    - Push verification into the M routine from the calling script
    - Avoid doing a PS listing for just maskpassterm as that can result in false
      positives when running more than one test case (which I did)
    
    expect/u_inref/contjnlbufwriter.csh
    - Adjust PID matching to counter failure where the AWK managed to match the
      awk script in the output AND the PID
    
    expect/inref/ctrlc.exp
    expect/outref/ctrlc.txt
    expect/u_inref/ctrlc.csh
    - Push control-C message counting into the expect script to avoid using grep
      afterwards. In some cases the grep target was not fully formed resulting in
      an incorrect count.
    - Push general PASS/FAIL validation into the expect script
    - Start the TCSH shell with -f
    - Cause timeouts to exit early when they happen
    
    expect/inref/ctrlc.m
    - Reduce the wait time from 60 to 10 minutes
    - Improve the stopping conditions
    
    expect/inref/gtm7993.exp
    - Add in sleeps to slow the sending of keystroke
    - Add comments
    - Change timeout conditions to improve the flow
    
    expect/u_inref/gtm8232.csh
    expect/inref/gtm8232.exp
    - Since the script still fails, change it to use expect_after
    - Attempt to improve startup matching
    
    expect/inref/sigproc.m
    expect/u_inref/gtm4661b.exp
    - Synchronize that M routine startup and expect script matching
    - Use timeout with debugging information
    
    expect/u_inref/gtm4661c.exp
    - Warn out timeout expiration
    
    expect/inref/tterase.exp
    - Wait for the prompt

    GTM-8137 [BASE][duzang] Verify counter semaphore limit does not prevent more than 32K processes from starting with
    qdbrundown specified.
    
    Test: Ran gtm8137 on all servers and base. Setup a passive source server on sphere and launched 35K processes. Verified
    the processes do not trigger error, syslog message is generated. Ran MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD to reset the flag
    that indicates semaphore counter is reached. Verified the previously existing shared memory is cleared. Verified
    previously set flags had been cleared using %PEEKBYNAME tool. The checked flags are: ftok_counter_halted (on both
    database and instance file header), access_counter_halted (on database fileheader)

    GTM-8476 [AS] [kishoreh,rog] Fix incorrect use of stack frame flag for spanning regions and nodes
    
    This change was motivated by failures in triggers/merrorhandling after enabling
    spanning region testing in the triggers test suite.
    
    There are four code changes in this review request:
    1. Remove the incorrect use of SFF_IMPLTSTART_CALLD (now
       SSF_NORET_VIA_MUMTSTART) from GVCST_ROOT_SEARCH_AND_PREP which did not
       create a frame.
    
    2. In a few instances, remove the #ifdef TRIGGER guards because the code also
       applied to implicit transactions with spanning nodes and regions. All
       currently supported platforms support DB triggers and spanning
       nodes/regions. It makes sense to remove the non-trigger code blocks.
    
    3. Rename SFF_IMPLTSTART_CALLD and SFF_IMPLTSTART_CALLD_OFF to
       SSF_NORET_VIA_MUMTSTART and SSF_NORET_VIA_MUMTSTART_OFF. This was done to
       better match the purpose of these flags. Also improve comments related to
       this flags use.
    
    4. Drop the use of SSF_NORET_VIA_MUMTSTART and SFT_TRIGR from
       sr_unix/ojchildparms.c. Remove HPPA code from gtm_trigger.c that I noticed
       as a result of comparing frame setup code with ojchildparms.c
    
    Test changes:
    5. Enable spanning regions for the triggers test suite. However, some tests
       rely on a specific ordering of regions, so those tests disable spanning
       regions testing.
    
    6. Tests that use prior versions disable spanning regions testing; sometimes
       only temporarily
    
    7. merrorhandling.m - in addition to testing mumps errors with implicit
       tstarts, the routine was enhanced to use the randomized gtm_test_tp to
       explicitly tstart so that the error handling would test both cases. The
       reference file required some massaging after this change.
    
    8. triggers/zgoto - this test's scripts picked up a number of changes to mask
       region variance due to spanning region testing. norefzgoto would descend
       down the M stack with zgoto using the trigger's name. This stopped working
       once the trigger's name started to include run-time disambiguators,
       requiring a fix.
    
    Release Note:
    GT.M handles errors from triggers on globals that span nodes or regions when
    the error handler does not clear $ECode. Previously when a trigger's error
    handler did not clear $ECode for an update to a global that spanned regions or
    nodes, GT.M would exit with an assertion failure. (GTM-8476)
    
    Test:
    Tests were run across all platforms
     -D_ALL
     -t triggers
     -t v62001 -st gtm4414
     -t split_recov -replic -trig

    GTM-5007 [NARS] [duzang] Phase 2 (final phase) : Parallelize forward phase of MUPIP JOURNAL using multiple processes
    
    README
    -------
    * com/applylt.csh : Extract/Losttrans/Brokentrans files are sorted when they are generated by MUPIP JOURNAL
    	so no need of external sorting using applylosttn_presort.awk and applylosttn_postsort.awk.
    * com/mupip_rollback.csh : If caller test had set env var mupjnl_check_leftover_files, do check of leftover files.
    	The v62003/gtm8394 subtest sets this env var. It forces a GTM-F-MEMORY error and makes sure temporary
    	extract files created by child processes are cleaned up by the parent before exiting even in this case.
    * com/mupjnl_check_leftover_files.csh : Script to check for any temporary files (have _<REGIONNAME>) left over
    	by mupip journal commands.
    * com/mupjnl_multireg_show_sort.awk : MUPIP JOURNAL -SHOW output is non-deterministic in case there are multiple
    	regions. This script sorts the output into a deterministic order.
    * com/outref.awk : Define MUPJNL_PARALLEL and NOMUPJNL_PARALLEL flags for use in ##SUSPEND_OUTPUT and ##ALLOW_OUTPUT
    	Right now they are not needed. But might be in the future.
    * MUPIP JOURNAL no longer assert fails in case of a user-induced error. So remove white-box env variables.
    	The following modules have those changes.
    		-> dse/u_inref/dse_chng_fhead.csh
    		-> ideminter_rolrec/u_inref/rolrec_intr_stop_idemp.csh
    		-> msreplic_G/u_inref/primary_to_tertiary_transition.csh
    		-> msreplic_G/outref/primary_to_tertiary_transition.txt
    		-> v53003/u_inref/D9I10002703.csh
    * ideminter_rolrec/u_inref/rolrec_intr_stop_idemp.csh
    	Check that temporary extract files are not left over by MUPIP JOURNAL commands in case of KILL -15 (STOP)
    	or clean termination (IDEMP).
    * ideminter_rolrec/u_inref/try_rolrec.csh
    	Now that a mupip journal process might spawn multiple children, do kill -9 of all children too before
    	returning saying mupip process has been killed.
    * lost_trans/u_inref/lost_trans.csh
    	The test expects the lost transaction file to be created in a.lost. With autorollback done by receiver server,
    	it is not possible to specify the lost transaction file name so just rename *.lost to a.lost after the
    	rollback/autorollback.
    * mupjnl/inref/extract_summary.awk
    	Enhance script to produce sorted output in case env var "extract_summary_sort" is set.
    	This is set by caller tests when they know the output would otherwise be non-deterministic.
    * Various subtests in "mupjnl", "nullsubs_coll", "read_only", "set_jnl" and "unicode" tests
    	Fixed reference files to account for new MUPIP JOURNAL code behavior (e.g. -SHOW=HEADER default is -noverify)
    	Where output is non-deterministic, fixed the test to make it deterministic.
    	Examples include
    		-> specifying the extract/losttrans/brokentrans file name explicitly.
    		-> printing only those portions of the journal extract that are deterministic and important.
    		-> setenv extract_summary_sort to get sorted output from extract_summary.awk
    * mupjnl/outref/test_verbose.txt
    	Due to the code change to set jgbl.forw_phase_recovery to 0 before invoking mur_close_files(), the function
    	jnl_write_eof_rec() now writes an EOF record with a seqno of 0 in case replication is disabled in the database.
    	This means the MUPIP JOURNAL -SHOW=HEADER output now shows a "End Region Sequence Number" value of 0 always.
    	This is more consistent whereas previously it could be 0 sometimes and not otherwise.
    * mupjnl/gtm5007 test was added by Kishore.
    * rollback_B/u_inref/repeat_rollback_after_crash.csh
    	Removed backups of db and jnl files as this test usually takes up a lot of space. Besides mupip_rollback.csh
    	takes a backup of the db and mjl itself in case of errors so we dont need this test-level backup anyways.
    * v61000/u_inref/repl_crash_err2.csh : Fixed a typo
    * Re-enable v62003/gtm8394 subtest for Linux which seems to pass now after GTM-5007 multi-process changes.
    * v62003/u_inref/gtm8394.csh
    	Rework test now to search for various forms of out-of-memory errors (not just GTM-F-MEMORY).Example is
    		"shmat()" system call could fail etc.
    	Now that mupip could spawn off multiple child processes, more than one core is possible. Account for that
    		when doing an "mv".
    * test/v62002/u_inref/gtm8240.csh
    * test/v62002/outref/gtm8240.txt
    	Disable huge-shmsize-part of test on inti too <gtm8240_solaris_ENOMEM>
    * mupip_rollback.csh : Backup the replication instance file along with db/jnl/gld
    * v62000/outref/gtm8121.txt : shmid can be 0 (happens frequently on Solaris but is possible in other platforms too)
    * forw_rollback/u_inref/verify.csh
    * forw_rollback/outref/verify.txt
    	New test for JNLDBSEQNOMATCH message introduced in GTM-7291 (Test Author: Kishore)

    Dozens of E_ALLs were done across all platforms. And all test failures were fixed and tests rerun.

    [GTM-8112] [AS] [maimoneb] Coverity audit of memory related issues
    
    Using Coverity's analysis of GT.M's OSS build, I audited most of the
    memory corruption issues. There are still a number of non-memory related
    issues to audit.
    
    Most of the fixed items are theoretical and won't happen in practice.
    Only the handling of $SHELL prior to a zsystem was truly vulnerable.
    
    Release Note:
    GT.M avoids memory corruption when dealing with a excessively large
    SHELL environment variable. Previously, GT.M would suffer from a buffer
    overflow while executing the ZSYSTEM command. (GTM-8112)

    GTM-XXXX [AS] [kishoreh] Avoid unexpected error messages in MJO
    
    The test starts a MUMPS job that does a PS listing to validate the MUMPS
    executable's path. A concurrent test executed a test system script
    looking for an error message. This script execution was present in the
    PS listing. As a result the general error checking scheme detected an
    error in the JOB'ed process's MJO file. This change renames the output
    file to an unchecked file.
    
    Release Note:
    N/A test change

    C9P11-999999 [AS] [kishoreh] avoid extract mismatch failures; REPL INFO intervals of at least 1k messages
    
    v53000/C9H09002905 failed when the test found only one REPL INFO message and
    could not perform the proper difference calculation. The changes are:
    - Removed the com AWK script that no other test uses and did not perform
      the desired calculations correctly in all instances
    - Create a new AWK script to correctly perform the calculations and
      error messaging
    - Removed the check for messages in the source server log that indicate
      a periodic flush of replication instance file header. MUPIP has not
      written those messages to the log file since V52000. Other test cases
      verify that the seqno is flushed to disk at regular intervals.
    
    triggers/gtm7522d failed due to an extract difference on the supplementary
    instance. Since this test cannot make use of the supplementary instance
    framework to ignore extract differences on the secondary, KILL ^%jobwait
    to eliminate the difference from both sides.

    [testframework][KISHORE][erdeniz] do not pass --until to journalctl if time_after is empty
    
    This was chosen instead of passing current time because during EDT->EST switch and when running at say 1:30 EST
    * passing --since=1:20 --until=1:30 returns logs between 1:20 EDT and 1:30 EDT
    * not passing --until (only --since=1:20) returns logs between 1:20 EDT and 1:30 EST (the current time)
    
    The latter though not correct, is much better than the former.
    The below would return logs of the exact timeframe in question,
    but that would print different times and might be confusing while debugging tests
    set since=`env TZ=UTC date --date="2015-11-01 01:20:00 EST" +"%F %T"`
    set until=`env TZ=UTC date --date="2015-11-01 01:31:00 EST" +"%F %T"`

    [encryption][KISHORE][ivan] use gtm_obfuscation_key for gtmtest1's encryption setup
    
    gpg-agent lingers on some servers (scylla, bolt and thunder now). gtmtest1's gpg-agent would continue to depend on
    the inode of mumps executable of the first build that started this agent. If that version is rebuilt,
    the inode of mumps would change causing encryption to fail.
    Using gtm_obfuscation_key to point to a static file (in this case gtmtest1's pubkey) removes this version dependency
    
    Test:
    The below passed with -encrypt on all servers as e1068212 and gtmtest
    -t encryption -st gpghome_perms
    -t locks      -st multi_user_lock

    The below is not fixed (it requires other fixes not related to this change to even run)
    manually_start/u_inref/remote_user2.csh
    
    Also, the the test started by gtmtest in the below sequence  fails without the fix and passes with the fix
    1. as e1068212/V995, run a test that starts gtmtest1's gpg-agent
    2. rebuild V995 (make sure the inode of $gtm_exe/mumps is different)
    3. as gtmtest/V990, run a test that needs gtmtest1's gpg-agent

    GTM-8421 [AS] [duzang] Receiver server should not shutdown for a null online rollback
    
    This was a minor change to avoid having the Receiver Server shutting down. For
    testing, the test case freeze's the secondary prior to replicating any
    transactions. This ensures that the online rollback on the secondary will
    always execute an online rollback that does not modify the state of an
    empty database.
    
    Release Note:
    A Receiver Server started with -autorollback remains active even if an online
    rollback does not change the state of the database. Previously a Receiver
    Server started with -autorollback would shutdown if an automatic online
    rollback did not change the state of the database. (GTM-8421)

    [misc][KISHORE][rog] increase allocation and extension size to reduce syslog flooding with GTM-I-DBFILEXT messages
    
    Test:
    All the tests passed once on all servers
    All subtests had fewer number of DBFILEXT messages in syslog (tens to a few hundreds)
    Only 3 subtests did not have any DBFILEXT on slower servers (atlst2000,lespaul) due to higher allocation which is okay

    GTM-5007 [NARS] [duzang] Randomize gtm_mupjnl_parallel in test system; Associated test fixes
    
    Fixes:
    ------
    * Randomize new env var gtm_mupjnl_parallel in test system framework
    
    * forw_rollback/outref/misc_quals.txt : Since there is only one region, mupip journal now executes without using
    	threads even if -parallel or gtm_mupjnl_parallel have been specified. So region name is not displayed
    	(which is done only if using threads). Adjust reference file accordingly.
    
    * mupjnl/inref/c002017.m
    * mupjnl/outref/lost_multireg_recov.txt
    * mupjnl/outref/test_extract_show_multi.txt
    * mupjnl/outref/test_verbose.txt
    * mupjnl/u_inref/C9C06002017.csh
    	Due to the code changes to do Phase1 of forward recovery until min_broken_time, the journal
    	extract output order differs. Fix above tests to do verification accordingly.
    
    * mupjnl/u_inref/lost_multireg_recov.csh : Order of extracted journal records within a multi-region TP transaction
    	is non-deterministic particularly with the upcoming parallelization of Phase1 of forward recovery.
    	Fix test accordingly.
    
    * mupjnl/u_inref/recov_no_partial_replay.csh
    * mupjnl/outref/recov_no_partial_replay.txt
    	Lost transaction file name is non-deterministic particularly with the upcoming
    	parallelization of Phase1 of forward recovery. So fixate the name in the test to avoid false test failures.
    
    Test:
    -----
    Added support for random values of gtm_mupjnl_parallel in test framework.
    Platform D_ALL run many times and failures have been since fixed.

    <v60000_gtm7398_failures> Fix gtm7398 subtest to pass even if an idle epoch gets written in rare cases by update helpers
    
    * com/mupip_rollback.csh : Enhance script to handle -since= specification to rollback
    * v60000/u_inref/gtm7398.csh : Use -since to force rollback to go back until the NULL jnl record
    				(presence of NULL record in extract file is later relied upon by the test)
    
    Test Plan
    ----------
    Ran v60000/gtm7398 subtest 20 times without any failures. The failure scenario that happened is hard to inducein 20 runs.
    So also manually verified from -verbose logs of rollback that turnaround point happens before the NULL journal record
    like is expected from the -since change.

    GTM-7291 [NARS] [duzang] Misc test fixes

    						which will happen later with GTM-5007
    * com/mupip_rollback.csh : Remove huge extract files if mupip_rollback.csh invocation succeeded (mitigates

    GTM-7291 [NARS] [duzang] MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK should support -FORWARD, -BEFORE_TIME and -SINCE_TIME
    
    * Change all usages of "mupip journal -rollback" to new framework script "$gtm_tst/com/mupip_rollback.csh". This does
    	a backward rollback as requested by the caller and does an extra/hidden forward rollback (to get more code coverage
    	of forward rollback in E_ALL) and verifies the two rollbacks did the same thing. The hidden forward rollback is
    	done only if the env var "gtm_test_forward_rollback" is set to 1 (do_random_settings.csh randomly sets this 50%
    	of the time currently). A "mupip_rollback.csh -backward" executes only a backward rollback. A "mupip_rollback.csh
    	-forward" runs only a forward rollback. A "mupip_rollback.csh -backward -forward" runs both forward and backward
    	rollbacks with exactly same arguments as specified. A "mupip_rollback" without -backward or -forward runs both
    	backward and forward rollbacks with the appropriate arguments (for example, using different .dat files for the two
    	rollbacks etc.) and should be the most frequent usage in the test system. The other usages should be an exception
    	(error scenarios etc.).
    * Use #BYPASSOK("-rollback") in rare places where "mupip journal -rollback" usage is unavoidable.
    * Use backup_for_mupip_rollback.csh explicitly in tests which dont use dbcreate but later do rollbacks (in order
    	to create the initial db backup for later use by mupip_rollback.csh in its hidden forward rollback).
    * Fix workcheck.csh alerts (cp *.dat usages --> backup_dbjnl.csh etc.)
    * ideminter_rolrec test uses common scripts to invoke rollback and/or recover. Only the rollback part of those
    	scripts have been changed to use mupip_rollback.csh.
    * Enhance mupjnl/mu_jnl_disallow subtest now that more qualifiers are supported by rollback. While at that, fix
    	existing tests to mirror the revised cli_disallow_mupip_journal() disallow specifications.
    * Enhance crash_fail/rcvr_failstopcrash_rs test to run with MM and nobefore image journaling. If crash is randomly
    	chosen by the test with nobefore-image-journaling OR if gtm_test_forward_rollback is randomly chosen by the test
    	framework, use forward rollback to recover the database on receiver side and restart replication. A real-world
    	use-case for forward rollback in replication environments.
    * RLBKJNSEQ message is now printed by rollback even in case it is a no-op rollback. Adjust reference files accordingly.
    * -NOVERIFY is now the default for MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -FORWARD as well as MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FORWARD
    	with the only exception being MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -FORWARD -NOCHECKTN. Fix reference files accordingly.
    * Change a few tests that are sensitive to forward recover output to use -verify explicitly (now that -noverify is
    	new default). Examples are ztp related tests ("mupjnl/ztp_broken_sing_reg" subtest etc.) which will take a lot of
    	effort to change and is not necessary to change because the verify default behavior is tested in various other tests.
    * Add/Update testcases for GTM-E-NOTALLJNLEN, GTM-W-NOTALLJNLEN, GTM-E-NOTALLREPLON and GTM-W-NOTALLREPLON to
    	cover all 4 combinations
    * Add v62003/gtm7291 subtest to test GDINVALID error prints ... in case of unprintable characters
    * Add new forw_rollback test to test the following
    	--> "verify" subtest : -VERIFY default behavior for various MUPIP JOURNAL commands.
    	--> "verify" subtest : Test of REPLSTATEOFF/REPLSTATEON/MUPJNLINTERRUPT messages.
    	--> "misc_quals" subtest : Test MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FORWARD behavior with -CHECKTN and -CHAIN
    	--> "misc_quals" subtest : Test MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FORWARD and -BACKWARD behavior with -FENCES=NONE,
    					-FENCES=PROCESS and -FENCES=ALWAYS
    	--> "misc_quals" subtest : Test that MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -BACKWARD -BEFORE works even if -SINCE is not specified
    	--> "misc_quals" subtest : -SINCE time for backward rollback
    	--> "misc_quals" subtest : -BEFORE time for backward and forward rollback
    * com/subtest_helperlogs.csh : Record date when ps and ipcs output was taken. Helpful in later debugging of test failures.
    * dual_fail/u_inref/dual_fail5.csh : Replace VIEW DBFLUSH, DBSYNC and EPOCH command sequence with simpler VIEW
    	FLUSH. Add reason (mrep signature) in comment for future reference.
    * dual_fail/u_inref/dual_fail6.csh : Add VIEW FLUSH to harden transactions in journal file. Add reason (mrep
    	signature) in comment for future reference.
    * online_rollback/u_inref/dbformat.csh and online_rollback/u_inref/default.csh : Rollback now issues RLBKJNSEQ
    	message which awk script cannot handle without additional context. Remove awk script usage with a simple grep for
    	successful rollback.
    * relink/inref/barrage.m : We have seen one failure on loaded system (pfloyd) with a 500 sec timeout. Bump maxtimeout to 700.
    * reorg/outref/on_tp_jnl_multi_reorg.txt : Simplify reference file (was unnecessarily complicated and hard to read/maintain).
    * v53003/u_inref/D9I10002706.csh : Avoid infinite loop of reorg just in case M program dies without creating
    	REORG_DONE.TXT (seen once in pfloyd where millions of logfiles were created one for each iteration of the while loop)
    * v60000/u_inref/gtm7219a.csh : AIX has been seen to take long time to reap defunct processes. 10 seconds was not
    	enough in a test failure. Bump maxwait to 300 seconds.
    * v62000/outref/gtm8121.txt : If the only records in a lost transaction file are non-logical records
    	(e.g. EPOCH/PINI/PFIN), no such file is now created. So an extra FILENOTCREATE message is needed in the reference file.
    * com/defaults_csh and crash_fail/u_inref/src_crash_fo.csh : Env var tst_rec_str is set only to -backward and all of this
    	variable's other usages have been removed as part of the "mupip journal -rollback" -> "mupip_rollback.csh" change.
    * com/outref.awk : Link the env var gtm_test_forward_rollback to FORWARD_ROLLBACK and NOFORWARD_ROLLBACK.

    [testframework][KISHORE][amul] we have had $df hang over 2 days, twice due to some NFS mount issue of file systems that the tests don't care about
    
    * The file $df output is redirected to, is only a signal file to not send any more mails. The disk full situation is in the output of check_space.csh and in diff file
    * ipcs is noted down by the subtests (also this file is overwritten, which means the next failure will overwrite it and proves, we've not benefited from this in the past

    Disable encryption/ioerr on bolt due to an OpenSSL issue
    
    The latest OpenSSL version (1.0.2d 9 Jul 2015) on bolt cannot handle
    legitimate key values passed in as hex strings, giving the following
    errors:
    
     hex string is too long
     invalid hex key value
    
    Unfortunately, there is no simple work-around because we use 512-bit
    keys, and thus the hex strings cannot be any shorter. So, we are
    disabling the encryption/ioerr test on bolt for the time being.

    [manually_start][KISHORE][nars] fix manually_start test issues; linux_distrib issue; move subtests around
    
    *) set_gtm_machtype.csh/set_linux_distrib.csh : lsb_release -si is a cleaner way to get the linux distribution name. Also move it inside set_gtm_machtype.csh instead of having a script just for that
    *) outref.awk : when doing sub, match for the entire word by appending # before and after the word to match. Not doing so would do partial matches incorrectly
    *) move gtm7936 subtest from v62000 into encryption, since that subtest definitely needs encryption setup
    *) move C9H10002924 subtest from manually_start to v53001 since it is a quick running test and need not be in manually_start. Also fix it to ignore NON NFS $HOME directories
    *) force BG in 4g_dbcertify.csh as it needs to pick V4 versions (MM not supported)
    *) force BG in 4g_journal.csh as the test uses before image journaling

    C9P10-999999 [AS] [kishoreh] Various test fixes; expect/ctrlc; ossmake; triggers/gtm8399
    
    triggers/inref/gtm8399.m
    - Concurrent DB updates in the driving and DSE use created a scenario
      where DSE had crit but was blocked on writing to the PIPE. The driving
      mumps routine was blocked while trying to grab crit for a DB update.
      Avoid DB updates while driving DSE. Using -nocrit with piped commands
      to DSE caused other problems.
    
    manually_start/u_inref/makebuild.csh
    - Use V990 for testing against development versions other than V999
      (this defeats the purpose of testing). Use $work_dir or git repo URL
      and branch information to test the build.
    
    expect/u_inref/ctrlc.csh
    - Expect output was chompin parts of the CTRLC error message from GT.M.
      Reduce the matching requirements in hopes that it improves PASSing
      while not inducing false failures.
    
    Release Note:
    N/A test change only

    Various test changes to allow using a single $GNUPGHOME instance for all gpg-agent invocations.
    
    These are the principal changes:
     * Most gpg invocations were tweaked to use the $gpg envvar and --homedir=$GNUPGHOME to ensure that no new agents are started because the command is being run from a different directory.
     * Adopted the new $gtm_gpg_use_agent variable that indicates whether the gpg version in use dispatches an agent program for passphrase retrieval.
     * Ensured that $gtm_obfuscation_key usages specify the full path (because gpg agents are started with a homedir different from $PWD).
     * Added invocations of reset_gpg_agent.csh whenever we need to ensure that the previous passphrase has not been cached.
     * Accounted for a different error returned by newer GPGMEs when the key decryption fails due to a bad passphrase.
     * Removed references to gtm_dist_plugin as redundant and misleading and introduced $gtm_tst_ver_gtmcrypt_dir to point to the original version's $gtm_dist/plugin/gtmcrypt directory, so that we would not fall back on an older gpg when switching to prior versions (due to their gtmcrypt scripts).
    
    Other notable changes:
    
    com/create_key_file.csh				Cleaned up and reworked to appropriately use the gtmcrypt tools for the importing and signing of remote keys.
    com/create_sym_key_for_multihost_use.csh	A script to be sourced on the local box when running multihost tests that ship databases across.
    com/encrypt_for_gtmtest1.csh			Cleaned up and reworked to appropriately use the gtmcrypt tools for the importing and signing of the other user's keys.
    com/gtmtest.csh:				Removed the warning about the disabling of encryption/gtmtest on any box with gpg 2 as useless and annoying. Moved the setting of $gtm_gpg_major_version to set_encrypt_env.csh.
    com/random_ver.csh:				Moved the checks for bad gpg version to set_encrypt_env.csh. The version filtering is now done based on the new $gtm_gpg_use_agent envvar, which is also defined in set_encrypt_env.csh. Readded the previously removed filter for plug-in versions on AIX not supporting the AES256 cipher.
    com/reset_gpg_agent.csh:			A script to kill an existing instance of gpg-agent based on the current setting of $GNUPGHOME. Required to work around the passphrase-caching issue in the gpg-agent.
    com/set_encr_debug_settings.csh:		Simplified various instances of inconsistent or convoluted scripting and got rid of the procedure that replaces "tmp" with the subtest name as unnecessary (subtests are now submitted in their own directories).
    com/set_encrypt_env.csh:			Added two new envvars, $gtm_gpg_use_agent and $gtm_gpg_exact_version, the latter in place of $gtm_gpg_major_version; (re)implemented the gpg version check; defaulted $GNUPGHOME to $HOME/.gtm_gnupg and $gtm_pubkey to $HOME/gtm@fnis.com_pubkey.txt (so, one common setting for all tests); got rid of copying .gnupg around and modified gpg-agent.conf; and moved the instructions on how to set up the encryption debug environment in encrypt_debug_README from submit_test.csh.
    com/set_specific.csh:				Added a new envvar, gpg, to point to the gpg executable, with a preference for gpg2, if available.
    com/submit_test.csh:				Removed the copying of .gnupg directory and its components to the remote side as the key setup should be identical on both sides. Also got rid of the encrypt_debug_README file creation (now done in set_encrypt_env.csh).
    com/switch_gtm_version.csh:			Removed the checking of gpg version (now done in set_encrypt_env.csh).
    com/v1create_key_file.csh:			Removed as redundant.
    encryption/instream.csh:			Adopted the new $gtm_gpg_exact_version envvar for excluding gtmpasswd on boxes with gpg 2. Also excluded the extract_load subtest on scylla because of missing certain previous versions. Finally, kept the $GNUPGHOME and $gtm_pubkey settings local to the directory of the test because certain subtests play with the keyring, and we do not want those changes to persist.
    encryption/u_inref/change_pass.exp:		Enhanced the script to expect and recognize legitimate prompts from various gpg versions, and to verify that the passphrase change took effect.
    encryption/u_inref/file_access.csh:		Ensured that dummy symmetric key files do not get recognized by gpg as an actual encrypted file using some odd algorithm. Included $GNUPGHOME/pubring.gpg in the operations aiming to produce an unusable keyring file as gpg 2 keeps everything in pubring.gpg and does not care about secring.gpg. Finally, ensured that even if a database gets created erroneously, it is disposed of before the next case to avoid subsequent case failures.
    encryption/u_inref/gtmpasswd.csh:		Shortened the length of random passphrases to 80 to avoid errors from gpg. Also, unset $gtm_passwd prior to invoking change_pass.exp as newer gpgs seem to only get along with the built-in pinentries, which is what our scripts punt to when $gtm_passwd is unset.

    GTM-8342 [AS] [cronem] Avoid repeat confirmations after restart
    
    Ensure that a restart does not cause MUPIP TRIGGER to repeat its confirmation
    request of a delete all.
    
    Due to the use of mu_interactive, the code no longer assumes NO as the
    default. It will repeatedly request confirmation if the user does not input
    some form (truncation is accepted) of case insensitive "YES" or "NO".
    
    Moved the module mu_interactive from libmupip into libmumps.
    
    Release Note:
    MUPIP TRIGGER -TRIGGERFILE presents a delete all confirmation prompt once. The
    user must enter Y or N (case insensitive). For any other response, the user
    will be prompted again. Previously, after transaction restart MUPIP would
    repeat its request confirmation of a delete all. MUPIP TRIGGER -TRIGGERFILE
    would treat any response other than Y (case insensitve) as NO. (GTM-8342)

    C9P10-999999 [AS] [duzang] Use a floating timeout instead of hardcoded values
    
    While the Source Server's flush header timeout is 60 sec, compression
    makes it easy to exceed that timeout. Recent changes have decreased the
    opportunities to flush, so we're bumping the max to 90 seconds. To avoid
    excessive sleeping for such a simple test, the waits are all flexible
    and end as soon as the passing criteria are met.

    C9P10-999999 [AS] [kishoreh] Reduce passing requirements
    
    As originally written, this test used a loop of 10k iterations waiting
    for at least 10 inerrupted MERGE operations. Due to increasing test
    failures, the passing requirements were dropped to 1. Another failure
    lacking even 1 interrupt prompted some rexamination of this test case.
    Switching to a time based mechanism allowed us to raise the passing
    limit to 10. Intermittent failures prompted us to reduce this test back
    to 1 interrupt for passing criteria.
    
    This test will continue to wait for 10 interrupts.

    C9P09-999999 [AS] [duzang] promote CMakeLists.txt out of sr_unix
    
    This change does a few things:
    1. Moves CMakeLists.txt to the root of the source directory. This change
    will let folks build GT.M using CMake without engaging in any massaging
    of the files.
    
    2. Fixes a build bug on scylla where gtmthreadgblasm.m was being
    included as a C source file in the CMake build.
    
    3. Eliminates the need to set LC_ALL prior to starting the build.
    Previously, the build would spit out numerous NONUTF8LOCALE messages
    while trying to build the UTF-8 mode object files.
    
    4. Eliminates the CMake configuration which fixed the ICU version. This
    fixing was eliminated by GTM-7375
    
    5. In tools, the README was updated to reflect the latest state of reality
    
    Test and tools were modified accordingly
    
    Release Note:
    N/A
    
    Testing:
    Tested on all cmake platforms. I need Gary to confirm that this works
    with Eclipse. (confirmed)
    
    Tested manually_start/ossmake on all platforms. With the exception of a
    configuration issue on estess, all passed.

    GTM-8399 [AS] [maimoneb] Delete all deletes broken trigger globals
    
    Trigger delete "*" operations will delete ^#t records even if
    ^#t(<gvn>,"#COUNT") is missing. ^#t(<gvn>,"#CYCLE") is updated only if it
    exists. If either is missing, the delete operation will issue a TRIGDEFBAD
    warning to $principal as well as syslog.
    
    Test:
    Tested on all platforms with
     -t  triggers
    
    Release Note:
    Trigger delete all, "- *", operations can delete malformed triggers records.
    Previously trigger delete all ignored some malformed trigger entries making
    them undeletable. Trigger delete operations using trigger names and
    specifications remain unchanged. (GTM-8399)

    GTM-6388 [AS] [cronem] Buffer DB and JNL extracts writes
    
    Added a new M I/O option called buffered to use fwrite() which buffers
    writes. This does not apply to reads and is available only to internal
    callers. Callers can specify a multiple of disk blocks to increase the
    default buffer size.
    
    The functionality will be exposed to MUMPS programs in another JI. As a
    result, sr_port/deviceparameters.c remains unchanged.
    
    MUPIP EXTRACT and MUPIP JOURNAL -EXTRACT both make use of buffered
    writes to speed up extract file output. Both buffer 8 FS blocks of data.
    
    Test:
    test across all platforms
     -D_ALL
     -t v62003 -st gtm6388
     -t io -t unicode -t unicode_io
    
    Manually verified, that a file OPEN'ed READONLY cannot be written to
    even though it was FDOPEN()ed "r+", read/write.
    
    Release Note:
    MUPIP EXTRACT and MUPIP JOURNAL -EXTRACT speed improvements. GO and ZWR
    formatted extracts complete three to four times faster than before.

    [testframework][KISHORE][nars] Test fixes to get_dse_df.csh (and the affected tests) and change_current_tn.csh
    
    1) get_dse_df.csh : Use one dse process to dump all regions instead of a dse process per region as each dse takes significantly longer time to start up when opening encrypted database files.
    2) change_current_tn.csh : If replaying, gtm_test_dbcreate_initial_tn would exist in the environment and if it did not exist, the replay file wouldn't have had it.
    3) The other files : grep for specific field from the fileheader instead of simply "Journal".
    
    test.txt
    with the same settings, dual_fail_1 on carmen was much faster compared to the run without the change

    C9P09-999999 [AS] [maimoneb] More sphere ICU;GTM-8433 ^%ZSHOWVTOLCL in outrefs
    
    1. On sphere, the new AIX 7.1 server, gtm_icu_version is not set because
    gtm_curpro can use the AIX default ICU libraries as they do not employ symbol
    renaming. However prior versions, before V54001, which should be able to use
    the AIX ICU libraries cannot. These versions dump core due to GTM-6592.
    
    2. GTM-8433 added ^%ZSHOWVTOLCL which upped the routine number counts and
    visual display. This required updates to the mpt_extra/rtn outref
    
    Changes tested on all servers with:
     -t mpt_extra -st rtn
     -t v54003 -st gtm6811 -unicode
     -t v60000 -st mu_upgrade -noencrypt -unicode

    C9P09-999999 [AS] [maimoneb] expect debugging; sphere does not have ICU 4.2
    
    README:
    This test change covers two separate failures.
    
    1. expect/ctrlc -> bolt has reported expect_spawn_id_expNN_not_open failures
    two weeks in a row. Last week I said that I would instrument the expect with
    some debug features and add a base level etrap to trap the last error before
    the NOPRINCIO occurs. I have made both of those changes and ended up
    moving some M commands from the expect script into the M routine.
    
    2. On sphere, the new AIX 7.1 server, v54003/gtm6811 failed because the server
    does not have ICU 4.2 installed (well it does, but it's in a weird place), but
    it does have ICU 49 in /usr/local/lib. I changed the test case to pick up the
    "highest" ICU version that it could find.
    
    TEST:
    Tested expect/ctrlc across all platforms and the passed. I have 1k test run
    executing on bolt.
    
    Tested v54003/gtm6811 on all AIX servers (pfloyd, lespaul, strato, sphere) and
    the test passed swimmingly.

    [misc][KISHORE][nars] Handle case where subtestdir does not exist (in case one subtest just completed successfully and the next subtest has not yet started) by waiting for it to be created.
    
    test.txt
    Introduced a 15 second sleep after subtest dir removal section in submit_subtest.csh
     - without the fixes, I was able to reproduce the case where gtm_test_watchdog.csh exited trying to cd to the previous subtestdir
     - with the fix, gtm_test_watchdog.csh did not exit

    GTM-5007 [NARS] [sopini] Defer interrupts around the ctime_r() call in GET_CUR_TIME macro; Fix bug in previous commit of GTM-5007
    
    README
    ------
    Originally GET_CUR_TIME macro had DEFER_INTERRUPT protection around a ctime() call.
    But since GET_CUR_TIME would be used by threads as part of GTM-5007, this macro was reworked to use ctime_r() instead.
    At that time, the interrupt protection was incorrectly removed. We dont need the interrupt protection in case
    threads are active. But otherwise, we need it. Without threads, it is possible the ctime_r() call is interrupted by an
    external SIG-15 (e.g. MUPIP STOP) which then takes us to generic_signal_handler that in turn does a send_msg() call
    which in turn eventually calls __tz_convert that deadlocks due to the interrupted ctime_r() call. Note that with
    threads in use, external interrupts are not possible because of the way gtm_multi_thread() disables those signals
    in the thread sigprocmasks.
    
    While at this, noticed the v60002/interrupt_x_time test was disabled for dbg because an assert was failing in
    mur_close_files.c. The purpose of the assert was basically to ensure journal recovery does not error out unless
    a white-box-testcase is active. But in this test, it is journal extract that was erroring out. No point assert failing
    in that case. Enhanced the assert to allow for journal extract/verify/show (have mur_options.update set to FALSE)
    to error out without an assert failure. Because of this change, the v60002/interrupt_x_time test is now enabled for dbg too.
    
    test.txt
    ---------
    The v60002/interrupt_x_time subtest showed this issue on tuatara once in a weekend test run.
    Ran this specific test 100 times on all boxes without the fix. Got dozens of failures within a few minutes.
    With the fix, ran this test 100 times on all boxes. And no failures.
    D_ALL was also run to ensure no regressions.

    [GTM-6858] [AS] [kishoreh] Move ICU edge test cases into unicode test group
    
    The test cases for GTM-6858 (and GTM7375) and GTM-7886 should reside in
    the Unicode test group since these tests are very specific to Unicode
    support.
    
    NOTE: I copied the 64bit ICU 4.2 libraries from lespaul:/usr/local/lib64
    to strato:/usr/local/lib (since all other 64bit libraries live there on
    strato). Previously, we had a set of 32bit ICU 4.2 libraries there.
    
    Tested on all platforms:
     -t unicode -t v61000 -t v62003 -dry (to ensure that the instreams and
     outrefs were modified correctly)
     -t unicode

    GTM-5007 [NARS] [duzang] Phase 1 of parallel rollback/recover (use threads to parallelize backward phase of recovery); Phase 2 (parallelizing forward recovery) will be done later
    
    README
    -------
    A GT.M customer reported the following time-splitup taken by MUPIP JOURNAL RECOVER BACKWARD.
    
    	mur_apply_pblk   : 16:40 minutes
    	mur_forward      :  8:36 minutes
    	mur_back_process :  1:11 minutes
    
    To parallelize them, I used threads. Migrated the below functions in that order to use threads.
    
    	mur_jctl_from_next_gen
    	mur_apply_pblk
    	mur_back_process
    
    The related JIs are
    	GTM-5007 C9D07-002329 mupip journal recover/rollback performance
    	GTM-6835 C9L06-003422 Re-architecting MUPIP JOURNAL ROLLBACK/RECOVER
    	GTM-5417 C9E04-002591 MUPIP RECOVER/ROLLBACK should be parallelized to reduce recovery time
    
    I have been using GTM-5007 primarily in email communications. Will close GTM-6835 and GTM-5417 when I close GTM-5007.
    
    mur_forward is better off using multiple processes instead of threads. But I could not get to that migration yet since GTM-7291 is a higher priority and I need to move on to that. Given GTM-5007 is stable otherwise, I am sending this review request out.
    
    There are a list of todos maintained in narstodo.txt. Completed todos are maintained in narsdone.txt.
    
    Description of changes for each git repo are below.
    
    gtm
    ----
    * Change sigprocmask usage to SIGPROCMASK; The macro does pthread_sigprocmask() or sigprocmask() calls depending on whether we are inside a pthread or not. Threads should never do sigprocmask().
    	There are a few exceptions to this (because mdef.h is not included, because it is gtmsecshr etc.) which are recorded as BYPASSOK occurrences.
    * Changes due to SIGPROCMASK now needing an extra RC argument (compared to sigprocmask). Macros CMU_MUTEX_DECL, CMI_MUTEX_BLOCK, CMI_MUTEX_RESTORE etc. changed to now use/require RC argument.
    * Change _exit to _EXIT (defined in gtm_unistd.h); The macro lets us add asserts that we are never inside a thread when calling _exit.
    * Change exit to EXIT (defined in gtm_stdlib.h); The macro (lets us invoke a new function gtm_image_exit() that does a pthread_exit() or exit() depending on whether we are inside a pthread or not. Threads should never call exit().
    * GET_CUR_TIME macro now expects a parameter to store the result instead of implicit parameter names.
    * Add comments before macros/functions that are thread-safe.
    * Moved SIGPROCMASK macro from eintr_wrappers.h to gtm_signal.h.
    * Added a few thread-related global variables to gbldefs.c.
    * Make gtm_malloc(), gtm_free() and related functions/macros in gtm_malloc_src.h thread-safe using mutex locks.
    * Make gtm_putmsg/rts_error/util_out_print and related functions/macros thread-safe using mutex locks.
    * Define new PTHREAD_CSA_FROM_GV_CUR_REGION macro in gtmmsg.h to get thread-safe value of "csa" corresponding to "gv_cur_region".
    * Enhance DEFERRED_EXIT_HANDLING_CHECK macro to do pthread_exit (and not exit()) in case caller is a thread. Threads should never call exit() as it takes down the associated parent process.
    * Change DEFER_INTERRUPTS/ENABLE_INTERRUPTS macro to be thread-aware and not tamper with global-variables in that case.
    * Change DEFER_EXIT_PROCESSING macro to be thread-aware.
    * Remove VMS_ONLY code wherever easily possible and remove the UNIX_ONLY reference now that UNIX is the only supported platform.
    * Define new function gtm_pthread_create() to fork off threads and call a function and wait for threads to finish before returning.
    * Migrate mur_apply_pblk(), mur_jctl_from_next_gen() and mur_back_process() to use threads. In the process also made a few other mur_* functions (particularly in mur_read_file.c) thread-safe.
    * Change gtm_putmsg/gtm_putmsg_list to print region-name prefix when inside a thread. The region-name is set as a key at the start of each thread using gtm_pthread_init_key().
    * New macro SET_FORCED_THREAD_EXIT causes running threads to exit at a logical point. Used in a couple of places (e.g. if parent process gets a SIGTERM, if any thread create errors out etc.)
    * mur_back_process.c : multi->regnum was no longer usable because concurrent threads might be running at the same time for different "regnum" values whereas previously one region was processed before another region started backward processing. Avoid jjctl passing between mur_back_process() and mur_back_processing() as that is not thread-safe. Instead use new rctl->jctl_error field for each thread.
    * Changed prototypes (and code) of few mur_* functions to return "uint4" instead of "boolean_t". This lets us return 0 for success and more than one non-zero value for various error returns. This means we need to check for a success function return using "SS_NORMAL == mur_*()" (previously a function return value of TRUE/1 was considered success).
    * Add asserts.
    * gtcm_pkdisp dbg executable now links in a lot more stuff than before because of a new assert (size changed from 0.5Mb to 19Mb). But since this is dbg-only it is considered okay.
    * Use thread-safe clock_gettime() instead of gettimeofday() function in gt_timers.c (fix courtesy Ivan). This causes weird failures in AIX otherwise.
    * In gt_timers.c, do not handle unsafe timers in case of a timer-pop if threads are actively running. To avoid the timer handler function interfering with the thread in terms of global variables etc.
    
    test
    -----
    * Fix various reference files to account for region name showing up in the prefix of messages from MUPIP JOURNAL commands now that each thread prints the region name it corresponds to in each message.
    * C9K08003315.csh : Increase COLUMNS env var from 200 to 300 since the new region name prefix made the journal recover output go past 200 columns and get truncated.
    * C9K08003315.exp : We have seen COLUMNS env var prevails in the end so no need of "stty init columns" inside expect script.
    * v62003/instream.csh and v62003/u_outref/outref.txt: gtm8394 started failing on linux after GTM-5007 multi-threading changes to backward processing phase of journal recovery. So disable this subtest there. It now only runs on Solaris.
    
    tools
    ------
    * Add ftpput alert about sigprocmask -> SIGPROCMASK usage.
    * Ensure pthread.h -> gtm_pthread.h and signal.h -> gtm_signal.h alerts occur.

    Various test changes to allow using a single $GNUPGHOME instance for all gpg-agent invocations.
    
    Principal changes:
     * Most gpg invocations were tweaked to use the $gpg envvar and --homedir=$GNUPGHOME to ensure that no new agents are started because the command is being run from a new directory.
     * Adopted the new $gtm_gpg_use_agent variable that indicates whether the gpg version in use dispatches an agent program for passphrase retrieval.
     * Ensured that $gtm_obfuscation_key usages specify the full path (because gpg agents are started with a homedir different from $PWD).
     * Added invocations of reset_gpg_agent.csh whenever we need to ensure that the previous passphrase has not been cached.
     * Accounted for a different error returned by newer GPGMEs when the key decryption fails due to a bad passphrase.
    
    Other notable changes:
     * test/com_u/gtmtest.csh:			Removed the warning about the disabling of encryption/gtmtest on any box with gpg 2 as useless and annoying. Moved the setting of $gtm_gpg_major_version to set_encrypt_env.csh.
     * test/com_u/random_ver.csh:			Moved the checks for bad gpg version to set_encrypt_env.csh. Additionally, the version filtering is now done based on the new $gtm_gpg_use_agent envvar, which is also defined in set_encrypt_env.csh.
     * test/com_u/reset_gpg_agent.csh:		A script to kill an existing instance of gpg-agent based on the current setting of $GNUPGHOME. Required to work around the passphrase-caching issue in the gpg-agent.
     * test/com_u/set_encr_debug_settings.csh:	Simplified various instances of inconsistent or convoluted scripting and got rid of the procedure that replaces "tmp" with the subtest name as unnecessary (subtests are now submitted in their own directories).
     * test/com_u/set_encrypt_env.csh:		Added two new envvars, $gtm_gpg_use_agent and $gtm_gpg_exact_version, the latter in place of $gtm_gpg_major_version; (re)implemented the gpg version check; defaulted $GNUPGHOME to $HOME/.gtm_gnupg and $gtm_pubkey to $HOME/gtm@fnis.com_pubkey.txt (so, one common setting for all tests); got rid of copying .gnupg around and modified gpg-agent.conf; and moved the instructions on how to set up the encryption debug environment in encrypt_debug_README from submit_test.csh.
     * test/com_u/set_specific.csh:			Added a new envvar, gpg, to point to the gpg executable, with a preference for gpg2, if available.
     * test/com_u/submit_test.csh:			Removed the copying of .gnupg directory and its components to the remote side as the key setup should be identical on both sides. Also got rid of the encrypt_debug_README file creation (now done in set_encrypt_env.csh).
     * test/com_u/switch_gtm_version.csh:		Removed the checking of gpg version (now done in set_encrypt_env.csh).
     * test/com_u/v1create_key_file.csh:		Fixed an issue where gpg would attempt to overwrite the existing keys, thus spawning an indefinite cycle of overwrite prompts with no input to them.
     * test/encryption/instream.csh:		Adopted the new $gtm_gpg_exact_version envvar for excluding gtmpasswd on boxes with gpg 2. Also excluded the extract_load subtest on scylla because of missing certain previous versions. Finally, kept the $GNUPGHOME and $gtm_pubkey settings local to the directory of the test because certain subtests play with the keyring, and we do not want those changes to persist.
     * test/encryption/u_inref/change_pass.exp:	Enhanced the script to expect and recognize legitimate prompts from various gpg versions, and to verify that the passphrase change took effect.
     * test/encryption/u_inref/file_access.csh:	Ensured that dummy symmetric key files do not get recognized by gpg as an actual encrypted file using some odd algorithm. Included $GNUPGHOME/pubring.gpg in the operations aiming to produce an unusable keyring file as gpg 2 keeps everything in pubring.gpg and does not care about secring.gpg. Finally, ensured that even if a database gets created erroneously, it is disposed of before the next case to avoid subsequent case failures.
     * test/encryption/u_inref/gtmpasswd.csh:	Shortened the length of random passphrases to 80 to avoid errors from gpg. Also, unset $gtm_passwd prior to invoking change_pass.exp as newer gpgs seem to only get along with the built-in pinentries, which is what our scripts punt to when $gtm_passwd is unset.

    filter test should not submit switch_over test as -distributed
    
    test.txt
    I was easily able to reproduce the issue by running one filter test with -distributed testfilter
    * ~/logs/testfilter.picked had an entry for filter and one for switch_over (which is incorrect)
    * only one run of switch_over test happened inside filter test
    * the test failed with GTM-E-INVOBJ
    
    With the fix, one run of filter test with -distributed testfilter passed
    * ~/logs/testfilter.picked did not have entry for switch_over
    * both the switch_over tests were run inside filter test
    * The test passed

    C9P06-999999 [HK] [maimoneb] Since port cleanup has to happen, subtest_helperlogs.csh should be called from the remote side too even if it is the same host - Handling not doing duplicate tasks is done in subtest_helperlogs.csh script

    C9P06-999999 [HK] [maimoneb] Since the reserved ports are deleted only at the end if the subtest passes, they would be present at the time of errors.csh check. Until we figure out a cost effective way to check for left over ports to signal a failure much later, retain the code and just comment it out

    C9P04-999999 [AS] [maimoneb] Increase the loop count to 4 and add existence check for the final output file. If the final file does not exist that means the loop exited without killing ONLINE INTEG. Change references to kill 15 to SIGTERM and MUPIP STOP to make script cleanup happy. Move the sleep time recalculation to the end of the loop. On fast IO machines the kill command would return successfully, but the MUPIP ONLINE INTEG would not print a FORCEDHALT message in the log file

    GTM-6901 [AS] [maimoneb] trigthrash attempts to account for all memory allocated during testing. It expects there to be no memory difference between the start and end of the test. previously trigthrash2.m suffered from recurring failures of memory leaked by roughly 34kb. So we introduced a change to allow a 34kb pad. Recent work has caused the need to raise that limit to three times that value. GTM-8213 will address the leaked memory

    C9O08-999999 [SOPINI] [nars] Allowed pre-V53004 versions to be randomly selected on AIX with Blowfish because they do not support encryption anyway and will thus disable it when applied. Filtering out pre-V53004 versions would result in V4 versions to be banned, which violates the requirements of some tests (such as longname/mupip_load_V4).

    C9O06-999999 [SOPINI] [nars] Replace the pinentry-program line in gpg-agent.conf of the copied GNUPGHOME directory with pinentry-test-gtm.sh, which does special handling for versions prior to V5.4-001, as discussed in <CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILED_due_to_GPG2_and_GTM_pre_V54001>.

    C9O06-999999 [SOPINI] [nars] A pinentry program to replace pinentry-gtm.sh in testing, so that older versions of GT.M can run with GPG 2.x. Refer to <CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILED_due_to_GPG2_and_GTM_pre_V54001> for details.

    C9O06-999999 [SOPINI] [nars] A script to be executed (via pinentry-test-gtm.sh) by GPG to obtain the keyring password. Instead of invoking pinentry.m for versions prior to V5.5-000, it follows the gpg-agent protocol to return the default password directly to GPG. For more details, refer to <CRYPTKEYFETCHFAILED_due_to_GPG2_and_GTM_pre_V54001>.

    GTM-7743 [Karthik] [shaha] Script to filter TLSHANDSHAKE messages that could be found either in SRC or RCVR log files.

Author: e1041912 <>

    GTM-7743 [Karthik] [shaha] Not all platforms have a openssl configuration file that can be used to create certificates at will (especially for non-root users). So, make adjustments to the default configuration file and use it for creating certificates. On Solaris, default posix shell (/bin/sh) is very restrictive when. So, use the one provided in /usr/xpg4/bin which is closer to the ones found on other platforms. Since TLSHANDSHAKE messages can be found in either of the replication logs, use a helper script to filter out these messages; OpenSSL requires revocation list (if present) to contain revocations from all the certificates (intermediate and rootCA) involved in the leaf level certificate. So, create one revocation list for each CA used and concatenate them to form the comprehensive CRL.

    C9N07-999999 [base][karthikk] We dont need this because sync_to_disk is more efficient for several reasons: waiting for flush takes longer, it may not flush the header, and the code is complicated.

Author: base <>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 19:38:46 2013 +0000

    C9N07-999999 [base][karthikk] A replacement for wait_for_flush.csh. Instead of waiting induce flush. That makes code much simpler. Previously we ere waiting until sync happened. That was taking longer, not flushing the header, and the code was more complicated.

    GTM-4828 [SOPINI] [duzang] A helper script for v60003/intrpt_timer_handler test. It initiates the creation of shared memory, changes permissions on the database to read-only, fires up a child process, and quits. The child process invokes an external program that sets a timer that kills the process.

    GTM-7540 [MSC] [weiner] changed foo to afoo as foo no longer recognized as a device parameter due to the addition of the follow device parameter.  Previously, foo was recognized as if it were FORM which required a value but was not given one.  afoo is recognized as if it were AFTER which also requires a different type of value.  This way the purpose of the test does not change - a missing value for a device parameter which requires one.

    C9N04-999999 [Karthik] [nars] Do not pass /job to logical definition of gtm_test_jobid as the gtm_test_jobid is not propagated to the immediate child (imptp.com) let alone the jobbed off imptp processes. Work around the issue of passing gtm_test_jobid to the jobbed off children by appending the gtm_test_jobid and gtm_test_dbfillid to startup.com which is guaranteed to be sourced by all the jobbed off imptp processes. See <multi_proc_jnl_fails_checkdb> for more details.

    C9M01-999999 [AS] [duzang] where present, use cmake for Solaris builds. Fix the copying of files from developer work directory using set echo for debugging purposes. Use an env var CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to ensure that the gpg libraries are discovered from /usr/local ahead of the system defaults. Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBPATH ahead of compilation so that the build process can generate UTF-8 mode object files. Error out faster if cmake does not build mumps

So, remove the corresponding test changes until they are fixed to do the right thing; MUPIP SET no longer issues MUFROZENINST and exists. Instead, it issues MUINSTFROZEN and waits until the freeze is lifted after which it issues MUINSTUNFROZEN. So, accordingly spawn the MUPIP SET in the background and add necessary wait_for_log and wait_for_proc_to_die

    GTM-6341 [SOPINI] [bahirs] Reduced the long subscripts length to take into account the maximum key size reduction from 1023 to 1019 bytes. Also modified the last scenario to not expect a GVSUBOFLOW error and instead terminate both instances normally after a successful update propagation. This change is due to the current impossibility to cause a subscript overflow in a spanning global with the same key that would not cause an overflow when the global does not span.

ZKILL espan and SET it to test bringing a spanning node back to life as a non spanning node. 10 large SETs reduced to 7.

    GTM-6341 [AS] [kishoreh] IMPTP is always started with VIEW NOBADCHAR because UGENSTR generates bad UTF-8 characters. This was not a problem on the secondary because none of the triggers fired by the update process did anything to hit BADCHAR. The recent changes to IMPTP triggers use SET dollar PIECE which causes the Update process to error out with BADCHAR. The initial fix put the VIEW NOBADCHAR into the trigger that validates the existence of installed triggers. This does not account for the situation where the Update process is restarted. The fix moves the VIEW NOBADCHAR from the trigger existence test to the invidual triggers that use SET dollar PIECE

    GTM-6341 [AS] [kishoreh] remove the SET dollar PIECE which SETs each individual piece as this generates a massive overhead in updates when not inside a TP fence on the order of n(n+1). fix an online rollback related failure because the transaction relies on prior SETs that were rolled back. change the usage of gtm_test_nsb to be zero, one and two

    GTM-6341 [AS] [kishoreh] enhancements for nodes spanning blocks and higher key lengths. turn trigger on gntp into a multiline trigger. add multiline triggers for NSB globals. the trigger test on ^%imptp also disabled BADCHAR. This is done to protect the update process from dollar PIECE which invokes bad character detection. TODO update the triggered invocation information

    GTM-6341 [AS] [kishoreh] enhance imptp to create records of the max record length and max key length, minus padding for both. val800 was hijaked to become valMAX, the max record length. With gtm_test_nsb enabled, imptp will convert valALT to valMAX further stressing large record sizes. With gtm_test_nsb_piece set to FALSE, imptp will not SET dollar PIECE with valMAX. This was added for overflow. Add three new globals for node spannng blocks test that use SET dollar PIECE. The sequential order of the SET dollar PIECE on the NSB globals should be randomized. TODO [Z]KILL of an NSB node. ORLBK should always restart inside transactions that are required for normal operation. subsMAX is the new max key length subscript which has a lot of padding. Ben says that this is ok and tests the compression algorithm. subsMAX padding is UTF8 aware. increased key length with nodes spanning blocks is only tested if gtm_test_nsb is set

    C9M04-999999 [IS] [karthikk] Removed the reliance on CPU load when comparing the mprof-estimated elapsed time with that returned by the time utility, since both measure wall-clock time and should therefore be relative to each other and not depend on the CPU utilization of the process. More details are described in <GTM_6819_mprof_time_discrepancy_on_high_load>, resolution 2. Also added more diagnostic output, such as iteration counts for threeen_time file and limits for simple and external-calls testing.

    GTM-7253 [AS] [duzang] fix the comments. change the mechanism to print out the current JNL seqnos and RESYNC change the mechanism to print out the current JNL seqnos and RESYNC seqnos for all instances. Call the rollback seqno the roll_seqno instead of resync_seqno to distingush it from the real RESYNC seqno. Use integer math when dividing. Set an ENV VAR to prevent choosing one of the interesting cases, either rolling back to 1 or double seqno. Change the command line interface to take a second parameter identifying whether to use the Journal seqno or the Resync seqno, which is most likely to be in sync with the secondary. hack to disallow resync to 1 due to INSUNKNOWN errors. delete code related to floor calculations since we allow online rollback to roll back to zero

For online rollback testing purposes, the journal seqno is more important because that is the highest number that we can resync to. change the subroutine that chooses the resync seqno to use more interesting scenarios. protect local variables with NEW. reduce the output. the script now appends to the CSH script that it writes with the resync seqno information. this gives us a log of the resync seqno chosen and simplifies testing

    C9K06-003280 [Santosh] [Kishoreh] In case of argumentless mupip rundown, orphan semaphore will be removed if present any. But this test does not expect to print the semaphore in the rundown output which was created as a part of the test. So check that only that semaphore - created as a part of this test - is not printed in rundown output.

    C9I12-003062 [Karthik] [RP] If an orphaned semaphore belonging to an already killed source/receiver server is removed by a MUPIP RUNDOWN, the corresponding MUJPOOLRNDWNSUC/MURPOOLRNDWNSUC along with a SEMREMOVED message is issued.

    C9I12-003062 [Karthik] [RP] It is possible that the process being killed does not die down immediately and hence holds the ftok at that time causing later MUPIP RUNDOWN to error out prematurely. Use wait_for_proc_to_die script to wait for the killed process to actually die down before proceeding with RUNDOWN

This is needed because the backlog (which we need) get purged faster depending on system load and other similar factors.

So if ~/.gtm_gnupg does not exist, we would need to create a .gnupg for each test with encryption selected, which could be very long and problematic on boxes with low entropy generation.  Added explicit exit value as it is now checked by submit_test.csh.

Add in dollar ztrap testing which was a TODO a long time back. Replace incrtrap with etrapAndGo.  incrtrap will be deleted in the next round of updates as test/com/incretrap.m replaces its functionality.

    C9999-999999 [Karthik] [nars] Now that x86_64 system is available in Little Rock, switch_gtm_version needs to be invoked to recompile libreverse (if collation is chosen randomly). Instead of adding x86_64 to the list of platforms where the sv4/sv5 is now needed, invoke switch_gtm_version unconditionally as that makes the logic a lot cleaner. On HPPA however, sv4/sv5 cannot be invoked as the librevese.sl will be in use and cannot be removed. So skip HPPA accordingly. See <endiancvt_DLLNOOPEN> for more information

Clearing ecode in the etrap left only the ultimate stack over flow error in the zshow dump. spell out the random function

    C9K02-003240 [ABS] [johnsons] symmetry test missed one test. When we load two trigger specifications, identical except for pieces/delimiter/name/options, with S,K,ZK commands, we should get two triggers, the 1st with S,K,ZK and the 2nd with S commands.  The extra test case reloads those triggers twice, because there is a bug that makes trigger 2 S,K,ZK on the second load.

    C9999-999999 [SLJ][nars] Increase minimum random alignsize used by the test system to 128 (64k).  Since the alignsize needs to be at least as large as the blocksize, changing minimum alignsize to 128 (maximum blocksize is 64k) will allow tests to use varying block sizes without causing issues with alignsize.

    D9999-999999 [ABS] [groverh] fix test2 to release all of its locks upon completion.  Fix test4 to explicitly lock ^A and add comments as to what this test is actually testing.  In normal operation test4 will take a 55 seconds Introduce a random skip factor, 1 to 5, in the iterations to reduce test time but not lose coverage. Improve TRYLOCK resiliency by trying 3 times the lock time test 3 times before failing for each iteration of the time test. bring the M source up to human readable terms by expanding all the M shorthands to MUMPS commands

    D9A09-001678 [AS] [cronem] put localhost instead of NA. the multi_machine test has a problem with opposite endian hosts. Even though it will not submit OE tests for hosts not in ATL, the test has a few commands that unconditionally ssh to the OE host to gather hostname and encryption status information. I could change the code in the multi_machine instream.csh, but changing gg_servers.txt is simpler.  The 2WL hosts scylla and charybdis also have OE buddies, even though they do not submit OE tests. I searched the test system for the presence of NA and found that NA is checked only for VMS buddies. This change only affects the offsite hosts sagaloo and sagpaneer. A code change to the instream would affect all machines.

    C9999-999999 [HG] [Amul] Any subtest which runs with unicode mode and uses multi-byte unicode characters in either file or directory name, must now be added to the list unicode_testlist in the instream and then added to the subtest_list. This is due to a tcsh bug in Solaris and HP-UX. See <multibyte_utf8_in_dir_name>

    C9J07-003158 [ABS] [kishoreh] fix remote execution line for A2E handling. convert the SCPed file to gtm_chset because SCP would leave it as untagged  EBCDIC which is a no-no.

    C9J07-003158 [ABS] [kishoreh] this script was created to handle an odd ball hang where other MSR commands do not. Ths file name starts with dumb instead of dummy because some part of the MSR framework was overwriting that with an SSH command.

    C9J07-003158 [ABS] [kishoreh] fix remote execution line for A2E handling. Ran into odd ball hanging commands and excessive weirdness where dummy in the filename was being replaced by an ssh command.  As a result one of the subfile was named with this subtest name a prefix, but two others use dumb instead of dummy for the prefix.

    C9J07-003158 [ABS] [kishoreh] fix remote execution line for A2E handling. Ran into two oddball cases where the SSH connection just hung for no reason.  Move those cases into separate scripts that handle the A2E problems and do not hang.  Subfiles retain the parent subtest name as a prefix.

    C9I09-003031 [ABS] [johnsons] define convert_to_gtm_chset as touch on all platforms except zOS.  On zOS convert_to_gtm_chset resolves to a script convert_to_gtm_chset.csh which will convert an IBM-1047 encoded file to either ISO8859-1 or UTF-8.  All other platforms use touch instead of the script making this env var as much or a nop as possible.

    C9I09-003031 [ABS] [johnsons] use tst_gzip_quiet instead of tst_gzip -q.  Use ls -T so that we can see the original file tags because compress is not preserving all file tags correctly.  It seems to be doing implicit file conversions and is stripping the text flag off of files.

    C9I09-003031 [ABS] [johnsons] use the zOS compress routine instead of gzip to save tagging information. This change replaces all tst_gzip -q for quiet operations.  I checked through the test system for all uses of gzip and found 3.  Two of those unzips did not affect GTM and the one that does had the output fles tagged. Create tst_ls to use in zip_output.csh because compress is not correctly preserving file tags as we hoped. It seems to be doing implicit file conversions and is stripping the text flag off of files.  The extra -T options will let us see the real tags before compress got its grubby hands on it.  If we stuck with gzip we would get untagged files.  At least with compress we have the ability to read the files in the format that matches their original.

    C9999-999999 [HG] [kishore] One of the main assumptions in this test case is that in the first step the current receiver would have hardened more transactions than the seq num to which the primary has rolled back after crashing. So wait for the backlog to clear before shutting down the receiver to fulfill this condition.  Else the last test S (B = min(95, 86) = 86) could not be done. Also before proceeding with the test further check that this condition has been met.

    C9999-999999 [SLJ][nars] Add error checking, error message, and error return to the compile and link steps.  Add -lgnpclient -lcmisockettcp to linker options - needed after the MM core file dump changes in gtm_fork_n_core() since get_next_gdr() requires both libraries - causing enormous code bloat in the test executable.  Add comment not to change gt_cc_compiler to gt_ld_linker for the linker step -- hppa needs gt_cc_compiler.

    C9999-999999 [HG] [kishore] One of the main assumptions in this test case is that in the first step the current receiver would have hardened more transactions than the seq num to which the primary has rolled back after crashing. So wait for the backlog to clear before shutting down the receiver to fulfill this condition.  Else the last test S (B = min(95, 86) = 86) could not be done. Also before proceeding with the test further check that this condition has been met.

    C9999-999999 [hg] [nars] Increase the key size of the initial keys such that each key almost occupies a full block. This way when these keys are updated later, each update will result in writing of before image of the block. This in turn will increase the chances of backup buffer being full and data being written to the temp file. Also increase the number of keys being updated.

    C9999-999999 [hg] [hk] Ignore SEMWT2LONG message (accompanied by the DBFILERR message) as long as that is the only message. This is because that script invokes DSE which could in some cases print this message in case it waited for more than 30 seconds for the access control lock for a region. This is more likely if some other process is holding that lock and taking a while to finish its operation (like shutting down) on a system that is really slow like irvhomer.
